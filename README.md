# Serendip: Topic Model-Driven Visual Exploration of Text Corpora

## Overview

Our project helps in analyzing the large text corpora of Reddit (r/India
subreddit)'s posts to identify the relationships between topics and documents.
We aim to provide insights to help a wide range of users within the Reddit
community, including Redditors, Moderators, Influencers, and Businesses running
ads. We will use different views and analytical techniques to understand the
relationship between different documents and text.

There are a total of five views:
1. corpus view
2. text view
3. rank view
4. radar view
5. circular packing view 

And each view has different charts to analyze flairs, topics, words, and their
characteristics like frequency, density etc.,.
