From what I know the drug has sideeffects and its efficacy has been contested in several clinical trials. The article mentions that the initial plan of testing 50000 people has been scaled down and a target group will be identified after recording their medical history and consent for the study. As a layman I had the following questions What are the possible sideeffects the drug has on an average person with no underlying health conditions Given that even the young residents in slums are more likely to have underlying health conditions due to poor living conditions quality of water sanitation etc. is it more likely that these side effects would affect them adversely What implications does it have for the results of the experiment even if its carried out as planned Link to study for this claim [here]https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5141369/ Are there any examples of similar clinical trials conducted on a population at this scale elsewhere in the past From what I know such trials are usually conducted in clinics at a much smaller scale..

Endlessly refreshing for BigBasket delivery slots Created a crossplatform program to notify you whenever a delivery slot gets available in your area.: Live at https//github.com/wrapaway/bigbasketnotifier Demo [Demo]https//github.com/wrapaway/bigbasketnotifier/blob/master/screenshots/demo.gifrawtrue Detailed Installing Instructions [Documentation]https//github.com/wrapaway/bigbasketnotifierinstallation This program gives you a system notification crossplatform Windows Linux OS X whenever a delivery slot is found available in your current delivering address. Due to current pandemic crisis of Covid19 A severe lockdown has been placed in India such that people look towards online services to get their groceries to them BigBasket is one of the popular services providing all of the resources online. However due to the excess demand delivery slots get filled way too quickly for anyone to order items for their given address. Some of the key features includes 1. Cross platform system wide notifications. 1. You can login via OTP all by the terminal itself. 1. Ability to save your sessions allowing you to login only once. 1. Logging enabled by default for better debugging. 1. Configuration flexibility regarding various options. 1. Program doesnt do any javascriptrendering via headless browsers or anything. 1. Polling is done via API endpoints rather than relying on scraping improving stability. Due to the current pandemic crisis of Covid19 I advise to only order items that are necessary for your household chores instead of hoarding supplies that arent needed per se. I have made the documentation regarding the program as clear as possible such that anyone can install and start using it in their systems However if you have any ideas to improve the section Feel free to send a PR. The program is completely open source such that you can audit it yourself if you have any security concerns related to the matter at [Github]https//github.com/wrapaway/bigbasketnotifier If youve any issues in using program or find any bugs or any other query contact me on twitter at [ugupta41]https//twitter.com/ugupta41/status/1249367355769016320 Notable Credits [Shantanu Goel]https//twitter.com/shantanugoel who brought this problem to me and helped me around in coming up with the idea and its working. Hes also wrote a telegram bot that notifies you when a delivery slot is available in Bangalore although its catered to his location and nearby places https//t.me/bbslotsnotifier [LeninGangwal/BigBasketDeliverySlots]https//github.com/LeninGangwal/BigBasketDeliverySlots There is another program that tried on the issue which inspired me to wrote a more stable program with features lacking in the original repository.. Crossfunctional discussion on Indian Public Spaces in the postCOVID world with Dr. Mathighatta Chaitra Dr. Sudarshan Yathiraj Andrea Milani Samartha Raghava Nagabhushanam and Alex McDougall: Tackling the concept of digital and physical public spaces in the postCOVID 19 world from an architecture tech economics health habits and social lens. The best discussions are when multiple functional topics revolve around one abstract topic instead of only focusing on one facet. An understanding of the abstract is woefully incomplete when only viewed through one lens. To get meta for a second this is also how we should be organizing our societies with multiple functional concepts health mobility commerce government etc organized around one abstract concept an individual instead of each facet of an individual being siloed.

How is everyone enjoying the clean air What can be done to keep it clean in the future: Im sure many of you have noticed how much the air quality has improved during the shutdown. It is all over the news right now. If people want it to stay this way changes will need to be made. But its clearly not possible to implement US style exhaust catalysts made of platinum and which cost almost as much as a new car in India. What alternatives are there to using expensive exhaust catalysts About a decade ago the US experimented with natural gas trucks. Hundreds of thousands were produced. The experiment failed not because the trucks did not work but because the corporations which owned them turned down the power to save fuel and this made drivers refuse to drive them. They could not drive safely with such little power on such heavy vehicles. The trucks actually worked well when they were not restricted with poorly conceived programming from office workers who had no idea what they were doing. These systems are already proven and can be installed on existing trucks. In fact there are thousands and thousands of them sitting idle on dealer lots in the US right now. If the government or companies wanted to try them out they would not even need to spend anything on development. Its already developed. They can simply install existing systems or import cheap US trucks nobody wants. Just remember to use proper programming and drop the corporate nonsense. As an added bonus adopting these systems would also allow India to use its large natural gas reserves instead of having to import diesel. India imports 82 of diesel. It seems like NG trucks would be very beneficial to India in more than one way.. Method to use youtube link and channel link with computer amp mobile. Coaching Classes in Vikhroli.

Roland FP10 and FP30 price/bluetooth functionality in India compared to USA: Im from Goa and im looking to purchase a digital piano. Ive gone through a lot of technical details between the roland fp10 and the yamaha p125 from past month now quarantining my ass off on this comparisons I know the FP30 is a better choice but the prices here in india...i think ill have to sell a kidney to buy the roland. its stupidly high . Roland FP30 goes for RS. 72824 or 952.96 Roland FP10 goes for Rs. 59973 or 784.79 Yamaha p125 goes for Rs. 53189 or 696.02 I know the digital sounds can easily be replaced after doing the midi wizardry im a soft dev so i can handle those technicalities easily later and by the looks of it both the rolands above have tri sensor keys which will yield much better midi data in case i do decide to swap out the sounds for post processing i dont know the right term for this. Thats why i prefer the Rolands for now and ofcourse because of their action no i havent tried them yet because guess what noone even has them on display here in the entire state.

Indians on LinkedIn think it is a memepage:  [https//imgur.com/a/0Qovilk]https//imgur.com/a/0Qovilk \I dont know what is up with this Indian community on LinkedIn and how people have made it an utter unusuable platform. There are genuine people who post job openings for SDE1 SDE2 levels but then there are people like these who think it is a memepage or something. Either treat it as a professional network or treat it like something you use to provide value to others. But we were never taught that in our schools right How to provide value At one point I feel like posting stuff to provide genuine value on there but when I see posts like these It makes my brain go off. Yes a lot of HR Managers do contact us over there for job offers. It is a good platform. But posts like these make the platform unusable. And seriously if you are someone who is posting these things. What are you even trying to achieve And then you find another bunch of MLM business owners messaging you every single week for business opportunity. Why are most people over there brain dead and act like they have no social skills and dont know how to use the platform or use malpractices. A lot of genuine helping Indians are there too. But why such ugliness At this age I find it unbearable that I have to scroll through dozens of garbage low quality posts to know about job openings over there Seriously man what the fuck is wrong with you I am pretty sure even you have come across work from posts like This companys Ceo is Indian that companys Ceo is an Indian.

Hello there I am from the 2020 iGEM Team from IISER Tirupati. Help us combat the rising nuisance of AntiMicrobial Resistance around the world.: Antimicrobial Resistance AMR simply speaking is when microbes in the environment gain resistance to existing antibiotics due to rampant overuse of said antibiotics. As a result of AMR drugs become unusable leading to loss of life and more side effects. Although it may not seem to be the biggest problem in the country right now what with SARSCov2 and the growing political divide in India. But it will be a severe problem in the times to come. it is projected by UN Ad hoc Interagency Coordinating Group on Antimicrobial Resistance that by the year 2050 AMR solely will cause 10 million deaths and by 2030 AMR could also force about 24 million people into extreme poverty. If this problem alarms you in any way then please consider helping us the 2020 iGEM Team from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Tirupati. Internation Genetically Engineered Machines iGEM is an international competition held each year at MIT Boston. It focuses on synthetic biology ideas that can be commercialised. For this year we have decided to bioengineer bacteria to degrade excess antibiotics in the environment. The 2019 iGEM team from IISER TIrupati brought home gold last year and we intend to make our country proud on the international stage in the same manner.

Whatsapp unkils are becoming too powerful: Just 3 hours ago A medical scientist researching Infectious Disease for the US Government in Houston who was my classmates in college. And our friendships are equally deep after his departure to America. Got a call from him. His first sentence was Devendra Ji Our PM Modi is some great man probably. I said Hey he is but what did he do now He said We have been doing research in India for the last 30 years on Infectious Disease but this idea of 1 day curfew never came to our mind. I asked Are you also making fun of Modi like seculars leftists Muslims Thukde Thukde Gang Urban Naxalites Award Returning Gangs AAP NDTV etc in India He said Oh nothing like that I and my whole family have been citizens of America for 19 years My annual salary is more than 15 crores in Indian rupees But the hearts are still Indian. Every major step and decision of Modi is completely separated from politics I wish the welfare of India and human beings I also saw Lakhs of Indians are making fun of Modis 1 day selfimposed curfew But in our laboratory a 45minute official meeting of all the big scientists has just been convened to discuss this announcement of Modi. You would be surprised this 45minute meeting lasted for more than 3 hours with a 1day selfimposed curfew to discuss contagious diseases and its impact on Covid 19 in particular All scientists were of the opinion that 12 hours is a very effective way to prevent the spread of corona virus by cutting every person from the world Because Covid cannot survive for more than 12 hours on any surface outside the human body. In such a situation being cut off from the outside world inanimate objects such as door handles Currency notes files courier parcels Steering wheels of vehicles Viruses on pens etc. will be completely eliminated And without spending a single penny in this manner as suggested by Modi Since there is no loss of work due to Sunday The country will be almost free from viruses These ideas were not thought of in the minds of the worlds highest level scientists of this subject If any of his advisors has given this advice to Modi then this person is entitled to the Nobel Prize and if the great idea is the brainchild of Modi then he should get the Nobel Prize for Medicine for his contribution in the medical field of Infectious Disease. I could not even speak a word. Here crores of people of my country are making fun of Modi Humiliating him as illiterate Devendra Singhvi 20/03/2020 Tldr modi is a genius and were blessed to be under his rule.

Do ISPs install any box/hub in your building to provide internet: I moved to our new home and had to get a new internet connection. I had an act fibernet subscription before but I didnt opt for it because their service is too slow. So chose a local internet provider. They installed a box in the ground floor. And the internet goes when the power goes off. I used to live in an apartment before and never cared for much of these things then. Just paid for the internet changed from local to ACT to hathway. All of them used to work when I removed the rj45 cable from router and connected to laptop directly. Used to think the cables are fiber and didnt need any electricity. This is a luxury I never thought Id lose. Now that Im living in my own house and due to Corona having to work from home and our power cut for 3 or 4 hours and losing the internet completely because of it is so troublesome and annoying.

The hardships of creating a completely anonymous account: This is just a sharing a recent experience of mine while creating this account of mine. This is a complete anonymous account and it has technically no traces of it back to me. This was created on a disposable Kali Linux Virtual Machine using random proxies all over the world This is technically a throwaway but I kinda like the name I got with it. The account creation process was already slow due to chaining proxies but then it was pretty slow to verify captcha each time But it is doable. you need to setup proxychains on Kali Linux and configure it using tors random proxies and then you are kind of done for the network anonymity but then comes the challenge of actually assuming an identity. You have to avoid all the general personal traits while creating the accounts. I chose proton mail for the email client but still it asked for a verification using mobile number This step took a lot of time as I had to get a phone number which cannot be traced to me but well lets say it was taken care of. After you have a mail id set up and ready to go you can pretty much get going on to sites which does not require a personal verification using some kind of mobile number. I think authenticator apps can work but I do not have a spare phone which I can load a FOSS OS on so that step is missing. It is definitely doable but you have to be very careful just in case you accidentally reveal some important info regarding yourself. This should help any one trying to get her or his word out and are kind of in a fix due to their identity being in a crisis. I would encourage people to be anonymous but be genuine which is a hard thing to ask for given the anonymity Kind of a see saw in my opinion one always goes down when the other comes up. Trust and Anonymity that is. For those who treat reddit like a social media Yes I have negative karma due to one comment which I posted but then reddit karma isnt my doing its all of you in the community If anyone can add to any way how the process of creating an email without verification can be achieved it would probably be helpful to all of the others..

I have a decent job offer in hand but Im more or less in jobhunting mode and the focus of that is leetcode problems and projects and whatnot. That being said my fundamentals and core concepts are weak af but looking at a few articles online I do find the content pretty interesting. People who are currently working in the field do you feel I should take the effort to learn these concepts or should I just stick to the leetcode problems and focus on landing a good job Will being good at the fundamentals have a direct impact at me being better at my job or is that something I wont ever need in my career I know it was definitely my responsibility to pick up these concepts in the four years that have gone by but what should I do now.

Its not just about the festival though I would advise against unnecessary trips to malls bazaars conferences or any public spaces that are crowded. The infection can be transmitted by those exposed to the virus and you cant keep a track of all those you come across. The only thing you can do is lower the odds of getting the infection so nonessential attendance in crowded places is discouraged. Holi is a social festival large groups play together and it takes just one infected person to start off the transmission. Its just not worth the risk he added..

After automation eliminates almost all labor all 1.4 billion Indians will voluntarily work in call centers dialing every possible phone number in existence and sexually harassing them: By this point Indian society would also be equal and women would also participate using a special algorithm to target those who would be the least receptive to harassment from a woman. Indian women would also form roving mobs to gangrape men and other women in this post patriarchal equal Indian society. Eventually massive radio masts would constructed in Earths orbit that can bombard every possible frequency possible with sexual harassment.

Another 15 need to breathe in highly concentrated oxygen and not just for a few days. We Indians are so fucked if this gets here: The WHO has sent a team of international experts to China to investigate the situation including Clifford Lane Clinical Director at the US National Institutes of Health. Here is the press conference on Youtube and the final report of the commission as PDF after they visited Beijing Wuhan Shenzhen Guangzhou and Chengdu. Here are some interesting facts about Covid that I have not yet read in the media When a cluster of several infected people occurred in China it was most often 7885 caused by an infection within the family by droplets and other carriers of infection in close contact with an infected person. Transmission by fine aerosols in the air over long distances is not one of the main causes of spread. Most of the 2055 infected hospital workers were either infected at home or in the early phase of the outbreak in Wuhan when hospital safeguards were not raised yet. 5 of people who are diagnosed with Covid require artificial respiration. Another 15 need to breathe in highly concentrated oxygen and not just for a few days. The duration from the beginning of the disease until recovery is 3 to 6 weeks on average for these severe and critical patients compared to only 2 weeks for the mildly ill. The mass and duration of the treatments overburdened the existing health care system in Wuhan many times over. The province of Hubei whose capital is Wuhan had 65596 infected persons so far. A total of 40000 employees were sent to Hubei from other provinces to help fight the epidemic. 45 hospitals in Wuhan are caring for Covid patients 6 of which are for patients in critical condition and 39 are caring for seriously ill patients and for infected people over the age of 65. Two makeshift hospitals with 2600 beds were built within a short time. 80 of the infected have mild disease ten temporary hospitals were set up in gymnasiums and exhibition halls for those. China can now produce 1.6 million test kits for the novel coronavirus per week. The test delivers a result on the same day. Across the country anyone who goes to the doctor with a fever is screened for the virus In Guangdong province far from Wuhan 320000 people have been tested and 0.14 of those were positive for the virus. The vast majority of those infected sooner or later develop symptoms. Cases of people in whom the virus has been detected and who do not have symptoms at that time are rare and most of them fall ill in the next few days. The most common symptoms are fever 88 and dry cough 68. Exhaustion 38 expectoration of mucus when coughing 33 shortness of breath 18 sore throat 14 headaches 14 muscle aches 14 chills 11 are also common. Less frequent are nausea and vomiting 5 stuffy nose 5 and diarrhoea 4. Running nose is not a symptom of Covid. An examination of 44672 infected people in China showed a fatality rate of 3.4. Fatality is strongly influenced by age preexisting conditions gender and especially the response of the health care system. All fatality figures reflect the state of affairs in China up to 17 February and everything could be quite different in the future elsewhere. Healthcare system 20 of infected people in China needed hospital treatment for weeks. China has hospital beds to treat 0.4 of the population at the same time other developed countries have between 0.1 and 1.3 and most of these beds are already occupied with people who have other diseases. The most important thing is firstly to aggressively contain the spread of the virus in order to keep the number of seriously ill Covid patients low and secondly to increase the number of beds including material and personnel until there is enough for the seriously ill. China also tested various treatment methods for the unknown disease and the most successful ones were implemented nationwide. Thanks to this response the fatality rate in China is now lower than a month ago. Preexisting conditions The fatality rate for those infected with preexisting cardiovascular disease in China was 13.2. It was 9.2 for those infected with high blood sugar levels uncontrolled diabetes 8.4 for high blood pressure 8 for chronic respiratory diseases and 7.6 for cancer. Infected persons without a relevant previous illness died in 1.4 of cases. Age The younger you are the less likely you are to be infected and the less likely you are to fall seriously ill if you do get infected table placeholder Read Of those infected in China 8.1 were between 20 and 29 years old this does not mean that 8.1 of people between 20 and 29 become infected. Of those infected in this age group 0.2 died. Gender Women catch the disease just as often as men. But only 2.8 of Chinese women who were infected died from the disease while 4.7 of the infected men died. The disease appears to be not more severe in pregnant women than in others. In 9 examined births of infected women the children were born by caesarean section and healthy without being infected themselves. The women were infected in the last trimester of pregnancy. What effect an infection in the first or second trimester has on embryos is currently unclear as these children are still unborn. The new virus is genetically 96 identical to a known coronavirus in bats and 8692 identical to a coronavirus in pangolin. Therefore the transmission of a mutated virus from animals to humans is the most likely cause of the appearance of the new virus. Since the end of January the number of new coronavirus diagnoses in China has been steadily declining shown here as a graph with now only 329 new diagnoses within the last day one month ago it was around 3000 a day. This decline in COVID19 cases across China is real the report says. The authors conclude this from their own experience on site declining hospital visits in the affected regions the increasing number of unoccupied hospital beds and the problems of Chinese scientists to recruit enough newly infected for the clinical studies of the numerous drug trials. Here is the relevant part of the press conference about the decline assessment. One of the important reasons for containing the outbreak is that China is interviewing all infected people nationwide about their contact persons and then tests those. There are 1800 teams in Wuhan to do this each with at least 5 people. But the effort outside of Wuhan is also big. In Shenzhen for example the infected named 2842 contact persons all of whom were found testing is now completed for 2240 and 2.8 of those had contracted the virus. In Sichuan province 25493 contact persons were named 25347 99 were found 23178 have already been examined and 0.9 of them were infected. In the province of Guangdong 9939 contacts were named all found 7765 are already examined and 4.8 of them were infected. That means If you have direct personal contact with an infected person the probability of infection is between 1 and 5. Finally a few direct quotes from the report Chinas bold approach to contain the rapid spread of this new respiratory pathogen has changed the course of a rapidly escalating and deadly epidemic. In the face of a previously unknown virus China has rolled out perhaps the most ambitious agile and aggressive disease containment effort in history. Chinas uncompromising and rigorous use of nonpharmaceutical measures to contain transmission of the COVID19 virus in multiple settings provides vital lessons for the global response. This rather unique and unprecedented public health response in China reversed the escalating cases in both Hubei where there has been widespread community transmission and in the importation provinces where family clusters appear to have driven the outbreak. Much of the global community is not yet ready in mindset and materially to implement the measures that have been employed to contain COVID19 in China. These are the only measures that are currently proven to interrupt or minimize transmission chains in humans. Fundamental to these measures is extremely proactive surveillance to immediately detect cases very rapid diagnosis and immediate case isolation rigorous tracking and quarantine of close contacts and an exceptionally high degree of population understanding and acceptance of these measures. COVID19 is spreading with astonishing speed COVID19 outbreaks in any setting have very serious consequences and there is now strong evidence that nonpharmaceutical interventions can reduce and even interrupt transmission. Concerningly global and national preparedness planning is often ambivalent about such interventions. However to reduce COVID19 illness and death nearterm readiness planning must embrace the largescale implementation of highquality nonpharmaceutical public health measures. These measures must fully incorporate immediate case detection and isolation rigorous close contact tracing and monitoring/quarantine and direct population/community engagement..

But i checked with other reliable malware softwares and results came out negative. Upon googling I found others have received such emails and some responses even suggested taking it serious.

Sadhguru is a pseudoscientific wack and a fraud. However the recent claim he made about breast milk actually isnt that unfounded: Relax I am not a Sanghi nor a follower of Sadhguru. I actually think he is dangerous and he has previously peddled a lot of pseudoscientific jargon. But that being said what he claimed was actually a citation to some recent researches which shows that breastmilks quality and quantity may depend on the gender of infants. https//medium.com/bigfundu/breastmilksadhguruandliberalsfbb55420c0fc This article is obviously written by a Sadhguru fan but the articles it links to is well legit. There has indeed been research on this and have found significant differences in both quality and quantity of breast milk produced for different genders of children not only in humans but other species as well. I am linking the scientific researches rather than articles 1. http//www.imedpub.com/articles/biochemicaldifferencesinhumanbreastmilkcontentsaccordingtoinfantsgender.phpaid23183 2. https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24105777 3. https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3586783/ 4. https//milkgenomics.org/article/twinstudysuggestsmomsmakesexspecificmilk/ this article was linked by Abhijit Iyer Mitra the right wing propagandist 5. https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1351272/ News articles that have referred this are 1.

Scientific American https//www.scientificamerican.com/article/boysandgirlsmaygetdifferentbreastmilk/ 3. Guardian https//www.theguardian.com/science/2014/feb/14/babyboysgirlssexformulamilk So yeah Sadhguru was simply citing these studies thats all.

My own fact checking Renuka Jain shared a possibly hoax scientific study on vedic rituals: So Miss Renuka Jain the one who became famous for her video saying people dont deserve Modiji shared a 2011 The Hindu article claiming that an ancient Hindu ritual has been proved by scientists to be extremely beneficial for atmosphere. The Tweet https//twitter.com/RenukaJain6/status/1226702402599866370 The article https//www.thehindu.com/scitech/ancientfireritualhaspositiveimpactonenvironmentscientists/article2103881.ece In this a guy named Prof VPN Nampoori is said to have been researching on an ancient Vedic ritual called Athirathram which he claimed germinates seeds at a much faster rate etc. He said gt The findings would not only help dispel superstitious notions associated with Vedic rituals but also help in continuation of such tradition for the betterment of nature and the environment says Nampoori. This didnt sit right with me so I went to Google to search on this. Being a fan of a YouTuber Potholer54 I wanted to get some research papers not media articles. And as I suspected I found none. Even in his own profile in his University there is no such study. I searched his LinkedIn ResearchAcademy etc but didnt find anything I may have missed something its possible. Rather I found this https//www.thenewsminute.com/article/keralaprofessorcusatsuspendedallegedlyfudgingdatawhileauthoringarticles64342 This news article accuses him of fudging data. I further found this https//ssmkerala.org/teamssm.html This is a pseudoscience movement basically trying to fuse Hinduism with Science you know the usual pseudoscience mumbo jumbo like Deepak Chopra. This professor is a member of RSS too. Joined together this clearly indicates that this was a hoax study just like the one that ISRO used Vedic Maths in their calculations for their recent space mission circulated by right wingers. I am still searching about it if I find something I will update. I am still a little shocked though as to why a reputed media like The Hindu would share such a hoax..

When God is made the Godfather:  God is an important part of the lives of many. He is there to teach us good from the bad. Help us in times of difficulty. This is all good until this mental construct stays within our personal lives. The divine character of God transforms into a godfather when some try to use his importance in peoples lives as a strategy to assert dominance and to fulfill their personal vendetta as he is unquestionable and all pervasive. Sometimes even his good lessons are twisted to generate inflammatory responses at a macro level. Attempts are made to spread his twisted tenets into politics economics medicine sexual preferences social stratification and many more. The deliberate attempt to conflate protection of culture with imposing godfathers twisted sayings saying is a step in this direction. Culture is just not that but also dance music festival which largely binds us together. These twisted sayings come in direct conflict with rationality which we require in order to society to progress and the globalized society we live in. The Indian Renaissance started by Raja Ram Mohan Roy around 200 years ago never reached its final stage. These twisted sayings of God are taken as gospel by people who are devoid of good education which teaches them to question everything. His sayings have been used to stratify the society without the need for competence also the roots of which run deep into aesthetic morality we start judging people by their other God food habits sexual preferences clothing style etc. Looking at the current scenario in our country its high time we start doing something about it. Why not start with exercising our voting right properly and wait for education to slowly change in the long term and in the short term exposing ourselves and people around us to new ideas. And lets not forget to embrace our culture in this journey by Meditating in the morning having dal bati for lunch then out of calorie guilt promise to do yoga from next Monday and do bhangra and have Biryani for dinner.

Plus they advertise heavily to their users. Lets say Suresh is an ordinary guywho uses Paytm to avail discounts on a kurkure packet or biscuits. He often uses Paytm at grocery stores and maybe medical stores. So my question iscant paytm use this data of Sureshs transaction and advertise Grofers or Netmeds as a more targeted adearning more revenue per ad Alsobased on the money spent on groceries cant they advertise accurate coupon codes for other apps I dont know how any of this worksbut just have basic idea of how companies like FB advertise and how Paytm works.

Why are Electric Vehicles Better Than Gasoline /ICE Vehicles India:  [img]dx7vga3avhe41 WHY ELECTRIC NEW TECHNOLOGY ALWAYS OVERCOMES THE OLD The pace of technological transformation has always been remarkable in the world. In 19th century there were few cars among a fleet of horses. Today there are few Electric Vehicles running among a fleet of Internal Combustion Engine ICE vehicles. ELECTRIC VEHICLES AN OVERVIEW The idea of Electric Vehicles began in the mid 19th century long before gasoline cars were invented. In 1828 nyos Jedlik a Hungarian who invented an early type of electric motor created a small car model powered by the then new type of engine. But the first fully practical electric vehicle was built by Thomas Davenport in 1834 in Vermont. Read about the Timeline here [History of the Electric car]https//edition.cnn.com/interactive/2019/07/business/electriccartimeline/index.html ELECTRIC VEHICLES EXPLAINED [img]ckf066jgshe41 Above A computer generated view of Tesla Model S chassis with its battery pack and powertrain. Picture used for illustrative purposes only. Image Credit Stock Image amp TICTeam An electric vehicle can be any vehicle that has at least one electric drivetrain motor driving the vehicle. Electric vehicle is powered only by the onboard electric motors and as such is considered to be an electric vehicle EV. The electricity required to power the motor is typically derived from a battery hence the battery electric vehicle BEV or generated in a fuel cell fuel cell electric vehicle FCEV. Although a number of alternative fuel cell technologies including hydrocarbon and alcohol exist among these hydrogen is the most commonly used fuel in the fuel cell. Electric vehicles are becoming promising alternatives to be remedy for urban air pollution green house gases and depletion of the finite fossil fuel resources as they use centrally generated electricity as a power source. FIRST VEHICLE SENT TO THE MOON [img]53isikppshe41 Above The Apollo Lunar Roving Vehicle. Image Credit NASA Fun Fact In 1971 an electric car became the first vehicle the man sent to the moon. It was the Lunar Roving Vehicle first deployed during the Apollo 15 mission. Called Moon Buggy developed by [Boeing]https//www.boeing.com/history/products/lunarrovingvehicle.page and Delco Electronics. SOME BENEFITS OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES [img]9kpds70jvhe41 THE SAFETY FACTOR Electric vehicles tend to have a lower center of gravity than the conventional gasoline cars making them less likely to roll over and often improving ride quality. Electric cars undergo the same rigorous safety testing and meet the same safety standards required for conventional gasoline vehicles. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration [NHTSA]https//www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2018/TESLA/MODEL2525203/4252520DR/RWD and [Euro NCAP]https//www.euroncap.com/en/results/tesla/model3/37573 has awarded the Tesla Model S a 5star safety rating not just overall but in every subcategory without exception. Tesla Model S set a new record for the lowest likelihood of injury to its occupants. Some of the electric cars has an empty front trunk thus creating a much longer crumple zone to absorb a high speed impact. [Crash test of a Tesla vehicle]https//www.youtube.com/watchvil2jmMRgFV8 Additionally the front hood of the car has a much larger crumple zone to absorb energy from a frontal crash. They also have specially made side sills that absorbs energy of a side impact. These features help reduce the force exerted on the passengers thus increasing their protection. ampx200B LOWER RUNNING COST [img]cqi4gdd7xhe41 Above Indian Rupees. Picture used for illustrative purposes only. Image Credit Stock Image One of the main advantages of electric cars is theyre extremely cheap to run when compared to petrol or diesel cars. When it comes to the running costs of Electric Vehicles there are two main factors the cost of charging and how far that charge will get you i.e. the cost per km. YOUR FUEL SAVINGS On average an electric car eg. a Mahindra eVerito with a 21.2 kWh battery capacity costs about Rs 70.00 to drive 100 km This cost is based on the tariff of 6.00/kWh for the supply of electricity through charging stations. The average petrol equivalent eg. a Mahindra Verito which has a mileage of 20 kmpl considering Rs 80.00 as the fuel cost per litre. to drive the same 100 km Kilometers would cost Rs 400.00. That brings your daily savings to Rs 330.00 when compared with the Gasoline vehicle. Similarly if the same 100 km is covered by a Tesla Model 3 with a 75 kWh battery the total journey would cost Rs 84.00 which brings your savings to Rs 316.00. [Check out the Fuel Cost Estimate and Savings Here]https//www.teslaindia.club/fuelsavings/ REGENERATIVE BRAKING Not only is electricity less expensive than gasoline it also has a much more stable price point meaning that rapid price swings are eliminated by going electric. In fact some of the charging stations offer low cost charging benefits which will bring down the running cost even more. Additionally an Electric Vehicle can convert its kinetic energy to electrical energy and store it during braking. LESS MAINTENANCE AND SERVICING [img]nyqq9gm9the41 Above A conventional Internal Combustion Engine ICE disassembled. Picture used for illustrative purposes only to show the number of moving parts required in a gasoline vehicle. Image Credit Stock Image Electric cars are safe and easy to maintain due to their fewer moving parts than a conventional gasoline vehicles as shown in the above image. As a result the battery pack and motor drivetrain need less maintenance than the equivalent parts in an ICE vehicle. This will of course depend on the EV model that you drive and how you drive it. ampx200B [img]1gbq4isothe41 Above A Tesla Model S chassis with its battery pack and drivetrain. Picture used for illustrative purposes only. Image Credit Z TICTeam Location Tesla Frankfurt Germany LESS MOVING PARTS Driving electric means being able to avoid oil changes like oil and transmission fluid cooling system flushes transmission servicing spark plugs drive belts and more. Electric vehicles require minimal scheduled maintenance to their electrical systems which can include the battery electrical motor drivetrain and associated electronics. Moreover because of regenerative braking brake systems on EVs typically last longer than on conventional vehicles. INCENTIVES AND PRIVILEGES Though not particularly an early adopter in [Electric Mobility]https//www.teslaindia.club/electricmobilityinindia/ India is catching up rapidly. The number of EV sales in India is growing swiftly along with its charging infrastructure. Under the FAMEII scheme commercial buyers are eligible for direct financial subsidies of up to Rs 15000 on interest paid on EV loans [Union Budget 2019]https//www.indiabudget.gov.in/ of selected electric car models. THE FUN FACTOR [The fun factor of driving an electric vehicle..]https//player.vimeo.com/video/208301252dnt1ampappid122963 HIGH PERFORMANCE One of the most important reason for purchasing an EV by the early adopters was the Evs high performance its fast acceleration feature other to being environment friendly its fuel saving factor and maintenance free. A study done by [Scott Hardman]https//twitter.com/scottiehardman for the [Plugin Hybrid amp Electric Vehicle Research Center]https//phev.ucdavis.edu/. An electric vehicle can have thrilling acceleration from a dead stop. Since electric motors respond instantly providing full torque from a standstill at 0 RPM. Electric cars typically accelerate far faster and smoother than petrol/dieselpowered cars. Ultimately we all want a vehicle that is more fun to drive. BETTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT [img]lq7pfccquhe41 Above A view of Himachal Pradesh mountain range. Picture used for illustrative purposes only. Image Credit Z TICTeam Location Himachal Pradesh India Electric vehicles can help mitigate the issues of climate change and urban air pollution which arguably are some of the most common issues of our time. EVs have no exhaust tailpipe so they dont emit any exhaust gases which reduces harmful air pollution particularly in congested cities and towns. Their major benefit is the contribution that they can make towards improving the air quality. LESSER CARBON FOOTPRINT The carbon emissions of an electric car are around 20 30 lower than driving a petrol or diesel car when charged with the conventional electricity generation. These emissions from electricity generation are also dramatically improved with the use of solar generated electricity. Power generation at centralized plants are much more efficient and their emissions can be controlled much easier than those emitted from ICE Vehicles that are scattered all over the world. By driving an electric car you are choosing to help reduce such harmful air pollutants which are let into the atmosphere from traditional exhaust systems. LESS NOISE POLLUTION An advantage of driving an electric car is they are much quieter than gasoline petrol/ diesel vehicles so noise pollution can be greatly reduced benefiting the urban areas of a city. Though sound of a vehicle is an crucial element in its design it also helps in alerting others on the road of its existence. Electric cars are so quiet they are now required by law to have an Acoustic Vehicle Alert System AVAS to emit an artificial sound to signal their presence to pedestrians when reversing or travelling below 19km/h 12mph. WHATS MORE In addition to the freedom of mobility for our future generations electric vehicles also provide a new model of renewable energybased power supply. They reduces dependence on oil slashes CO2 emissions and allows the vehicles of tomorrow to be fully integrated into new multimodal traffic system models. Advanced technologies will play a crucial role in enhancing the enduser experience of driving electric vehicles and interaction with EVs associated activities. For example wireless induction charging and connected EVs. Furthermore artificially intelligent Ai amp immersive technologies are being used by multiple companies to create Autonomous driverless/Selfdriving vehicles.

Just the other day I had reported a bunch of tweets calling for violence against protestors in ShaheenBagh and yet after more than 96 hours these tweets are still on their platform. Compare that with how effectively they shut down the calls for violence in the US where they shut down the whole accounts for shit way less serious than that. They shouldnt be allowed to get away with this. They should be pressured into acting more effectively against hatemongering on their platforms.

Smartphones Ownership Survey: 80 of people consider it vital to invest in a Protection Plan for their smartphones if they have had a service history in the past reveals Servifys Smartphone Ownership Survey. This was one of the key insights that came out from the survey that was run across the country with 1000 smartphone users participating. People who have had firsthand experience with the high cost of repairs tend to value investing in Protection Plans a lot more than those who havent. The survey also throws light on where most users tend to drop their phone doing what activity and number of times they tend to drop it. 62 respondents reported to have been multitasking when they dropped their smartphone while 29 were in a crowded place. 50 respondents were on the move when they dropped their smartphone while 39 and 33 said the incident took place in their living room and at work respectively. The survey also compares the percentage of men dropping their smartphone against women and reveals that 89 of women have dropped their phone at least once compared to 85 of men. While comparing multiple drops 73 of women admitted they have dropped their phone on 3 or more occasions compared to 67 of men. The results prove that investing in Protection Plans makes more sense than paying the high cost of smartphone repair especially since dropping a phone is a common occurrence and likely to happen without notice..

Our protesters need to learn from these:  https//np.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/cj3epd/howhongkongprotestorsdealwithteargas/ Hong kong protesters used to diffuse the tear gases with water or liquid N2. gtA few facts about tear gas. 1. Its not a gas. Its physical particulate which needs to stay hot to smolder. It cools as it spreads so it doesnt spread very far very long. 2. Because its not a gas dousing with water cools the can and interrupts the smoke minimizes pain from the emissions and takes the sting out of the air. 3. Because its not a gas the sting/choke falls out of the air rather quickly as the smoke cools. This is why salvos of multiple canisters have to be lobbed together to be at all effective. 4. Theyre not cheap so police departments never have more than a few hundred on hand in the field. If you can eliminate only 1 in 3 as they fall towards you the whole effect is minimized.

Will India embrace blockchain: India has followed China in its wish to embrace the blockchain technology. The India Times reported on Nov. 27 2019 that Indias Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology is set to embrace blockchain technology adopting a national strategy. The minister of state for electronics and information technology Sanjay Dhotre said a few weeks ago gtConsidering the potential of Blockchain Technology and the need for shared infrastructure for different use cases an approach paper on National Level Blockchain Framework is being prepared.\[...\] Blockchain Technology as one of the important research areas having application potential in different domains such as Governance Banking and Finance Cyber Security and so on. Besides the Indian Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has supported a blockchain project Distributed Centre of Excellence in Blockchain Technology. Blockchainbased Proof of Existence PoE framework is being developed for different uses authenticating academic certificates sale deeds and other documents by the ministry. Dhotre added gtBy using the PoE framework \[a\] solution is developed to authenticate academic certificates. Blockchain technology has also been used and PoC \[proofofconcept\] is developed for vehicle life cycle management and hotel registry management. India is developing a property registration based on the blockchain which is being piloted in Telangana state. Other blockchain usecases are focused on cloud security trade finance and central KYC. It is worth noting that India has been experimenting with blockchain since 2017. According to Deloittes research conducted in April 2017 Indian players tried to implement blockchain in such spheres as trade finance supply chain financing eKYC document management crossborder payments and others. Though India seems to be problockchain it is still negative on crypto. On July 16 2019 India proposed a draft bill banning trading and using cryptocurrencies. To separate cryptocurrency from digital rupee and digital foreign currencies which are backed by Central banks the government has given a definition of crypto in the draft bill gtAny information or code or number or token not being part of any official digital currency generated through cryptographic means or otherwise providing a digital representation of value which is exchange with or without consideration with the promise or representation of having inherent value in any business activity which may involve risk of loss or an expectation of profits or income or functions as a store of value or a unit of account and includes its use in any financial transaction or investment but not limited to investment schemes. Apart from that the report has named several reasons to ban crypto and impose fines and penalties for conducting any activities connected with it in India. 1. Crypto is created by nonsovereigns and serves as a private enterprise in this sense. 2. Crypto has no underlying intrinsic value and lacks all the characteristics of a currency. 3. Crypto has no fixed nominal value so it neither acts as a store of value nor as a medium of exchange. 4. Crypto is extremely volatile. 5. Crypto cannot serve the purpose of a currency as it is inconsistent with the essential functions of money/currency so it cannot replace fiat. Processing img il7amik7bm341....

PRIME REASONS TO CHOOSE FLUTTER FOR IOS DEVELOPMENT amp ANDROID DEVELOPMENT IN 2019: Xamarin PhoneGap React Native and now Flutter. Flutter is a new addition in the list chosen for mobile app development frameworks. Flutter has been creating a lot of waves in the sea of businesses due to its opensource nature. Plus its a crossplatform framework that requires writing only a single code. And this code forms the base of easier and faster app development. Flutter has solved one of the main challenges of businesses of the current era providing impactful user experiences irrespective of device or channel. App development frameworks providing excellent crossplatform experiences somehow lagged as compared to the experiences provided by native apps. Flutter app development uses a great combination of Dart programming and Androids Material Design card motifs. However the question is what is the difference between Flutter and other such platforms and why should a business switch to it Here are some good reasons why it is beneficial to start using Flutter for mobile app development ampx200B ampx200B [img]upwa41jucy241 ampx200B WHAT IS FLUTTER This is a Googleowned mobile app SDK software development kit developed as a complete package with widgets tools and frameworks to simplify the process of building and deploying mobile apps on both iOS and Android platforms. As a crossplatform development platform it means that you do not need to separate the coding for your Android or iOS platforms. You simply use one codebase for both platforms. Besides it also has the following traits It is free and opensource. It is based on Dart. Its architecture is based on reactive programming. 1 It Has Successfully Overcome Crossplatform Limitations Designing a truly crossplatform development framework has been a major challenge for tech companies. But Flutter has overcome the limitations by making coding for both Android and iOS easy on the same framework. Simply write once but use it on different platforms. 2. Quick Development Concept Flutter is not a web technology but it has taken the fast development concept a step further. For instance using traditional compilers are not easy. Hence you can use dynamic scripting languages to experience a good performance of the compiled languages. You can opt for Dart as a programming language as it features a powerful system. Dart has two modes interpreted and compiled modes. Its interpreted mode offers a great reload experience whereas its compiled mode helps in compiling an application down to native machine code when you are about to launch the app. The exceptional features of Dart prove that its amazing for developing mobile apps and having a unique experience for Flutter. 3. UI Factors Flutter allows and assists you as well as allow building attractive and beautiful applications. Every Flutter feature always focuses on the Native enduser experience. Flutters fully layered architecture gives developers various flexible development options like fullcustomization controlling every pixel on the screen with its powerful immixing inclinations without limiting overlay and animated graphics video text and controls and many more. For both iOS and Android Flutter incorporates a full setup of widgets that is proficient to deliver pixelperfect experience and Googles open design system for digital experiences. 4 Native Performance With a full set of attractive features like navigation scrolling icons and fonts Flutter has become the most adoptable Native Framework in the mobile application development industry.Widgets are the central class hierarchy in this framework and it provides a natural look in every application regardless of the feeling of the screen size for both iOS and Android. Every development framework has a mother code. And for Flutter that is Dart. So it gets important to discuss it. 5 BUILTIN MOBILE APP TESTING The programming language used by Flutter i.e. Dart assists in performing unit tests and a separate widget for testing interface communications. The individual package called Flutter Driver runs all the tests itself mitigating the need for any testing plugins. Plus the developers dont have to test the app on various devices too. Since the app is built on the same code that works for all versions testing gets easier because experts have to perform tests on a single version only. Fast Documentation helps in going through different levels at which Flutter apps can be tested. 6 FIREBASE SUPPORT Compliance with Firebase means there is no need to build backend plus it enables a quicker launch of application. Apart from cloud storage realtime databases hosting etc it makes your infrastructure come out as something which can be scaled is without a server. Plus when it is integrated with an automation tool processes like Fastlane can be released that facilitates constant delivery. Also it doesnt need a DevOps support system. 7 CI/CD Assistance Servers like Xcode is capable of consistent integration and delivery CI/CD of iOS apps however when it comes to larger teams it is not scalable. Currently developers either use Fastlane for inhouse tests or cloud technologies like Nevercode and Travis CI are used for outsourcing. However Flutter has its ties strengthened with Nevercode that builds Code Magic for continuous integration and delivery. Code magic is a solution that is capable of developing detecting testing and packaging the Flutter apps without any need to configure them. ampx200B [Choose a best flutter app development company in india BSP Technologies]https//www.bsptechno.com/primereasonstochooseflutterforiosdevelopmentandroiddevelopmentin2019/. Hyderabad Metro App Get routes fare live metro timings information: Hello Good People of Hyderabad I have big hopes that Metro setup and increased will solve a lot of our traffic problems. Hopefully a lot of us start using Hyderabad Metro as a convenient mode of commute. I have switched to using Metro from my personal vehicle and I love the convenience while commuting no traffic no pollution exposure no honking. However during the initial days I faced some troubles related to routes maps fare estimation and live train timings but over time I was able to figure out a lot of these things.I thought there were a lot of people like me who might shy away from using the Metro because of not being aware. While this information is available online it would be nice to access this information on the go on your smartphone. So I made a small app for Hyderabad Metro users compiling all the important information that a metro rider would be looking for. Heres the link [https//play.google.com/store/apps/detailsidapp.navigator.hyderabadmetroapp]https//play.google.com/store/apps/detailsidapp.navigator.hyderabadmetroapp If youre a metro rider or looking at Hyderabad Metro as a commute option please give it a try and share your feedback.

Using Smartphone First Thing In The Morning Is Harmful: Smartphones make a good servant but a bad master People might feel like theyre more connected to the world by being so close to their phones at all times. Even though they can help us be more productive and improve the quality of our lives it can also be a major source of distraction and stress. the cons seem to outweigh the pros overall. When we wake up in the morning checking social media notifications we are waking up on other peoples thoughts and updates rather than thinking about us. Notifications like reminder for your pending bills controversial news and lots of other unwanted stuffs can create stress distract your mind and also trigger anxiety. When checking social media and other entertainment notifications the brain releases lot of dopamine a neurochemical that makes you feel rewarded. The brain craves dopamine like an eightyearold craves candy so it will stimulate the repetition of behaviours that lead to the dopamine release. In other words when you start your day by mindlessly scrolling through social media or other unwanted news your brain will stimulate you to repeat this behavior throughout the day as it knows it will quickly and easily feel good especially when your day is less stimulating or gets challenging. This will pollute your brain with unwanted information as well as waste your time.. Sundar Pichai made CEO in Alphabets biggest bet. Sand Casting.

But when you snooze the alarm and sleep off after already waking once Sleep experts say your brain and body are more likely to experience a discomfort called sleep inertia. Sleep inertia can stay with you throughout the day making you actually feel more tired throughout the day.

Nighttime tourism proposed in Araku forests but will it end up endangering wildlife. How was Ewaste handled in India a decade ago: Tags KABBADI WALAS EWASTE CLIMATE CHANGE REFRIGERANTS ELECTRONIC COOLING PRODUCTS. \ At some point of your life you must have heard about green house gases like carbon dioxide and how their increased amount in atmosphere due to human activities like over exploitation of fossil fuels for the use of transportation electricity production and industrialization have been causing problems like global warming or climate change which further are causing a magnitude of other problems like destruction of sea life dangerous air pollution levels abnormally quick melting of glaciers leading to rising sea levels which are eventually going to engulf the coastal areas where 10 of the human resides. All this due to the booming of green house gases like carbon dioxide. Now let me introduce you all to a human made monstrosity whose destructive properties against environment seems to be second only to the nuclear bombs. I came across it while doing some personal research on climate change and Its called refrigerant These are a group of chemical substances found in pretty much everything that cools and sometimes in things that heat most commonly air conditioners fridges freezers and vehicle air conditioners. Fridges or freezers manufactured or imported after 1995 used a refrigerant called R12 which is \10900 times more powerful a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide \An ozone depleting CFC \Mainly found in fridges and freezers. approximately 65 of fridges/freezers at transfer stations and scrap yards \banned under the Montreal protocol and Illegal to buy or sell and further replaced by R134a in 1995. The average fridge or freezer usually contains 100500 grams refrigerant with an air conditioner usually carrying 12kg of refrigerant. One kilogram of R12 has the same effect on global warming as 10 tonnes of carbon dioxide.... Mind. blown. Refrigerants dont usually leak from appliances in working condition as they work in closed circuit. But it was 1995 and beforewhen people were totally unaware about ewaste and highly unaware about climate change most still are Now think of all those people back then selling their old AC or fridges to kabaddi walas who further sell them to informal recyclers who have no idea how to handle ewaste dismantling the parts and leaking the monster into the atmosphere. Imagine how many tonnes of refrigerants had been released into the environment due to mishandling of these expired/defunct products. It was not their fault they were just unaware but still....it makes me shudder thinking about how much damage we have done to the environment whose consequences we and the generations after us will surely face in multiple folds. And its just one aspect of ewaste. In case your wondering whats the situation of ewaste now in modern India then lemme tell you its bleak.

I was struggling. I started feeling like a loser. I tried but I had never studied for long hours before I lacked concentration and many more things which were never taught at my school so I found it very hard. Fast forward to JEE results I couldnt get into IIT. I got into an average GOVT. engineering college by this time I had lost my confidence I stopped taking interest in college just passed the exams. Faculty was also below average. I had no idea what I am going to do next I thought I may get placement in an average company.

Motorola One Macro Review Xiaomi : [removed]. Is India going to miss 5G bus :  Okay I have been reading about 5G network for a month and its possible roll out in India. I am not an expert on the topic and I certainly dont belong to telecommunication sector so I might make some mistakes so please bear with me and correct me if I am wrong somewhere. We all know how important the 5G is for AI self driving cars and internet of things. 5G is said to be next big thing in technology revolution and as a nation with huge human resources we should exploit it as much as possible. But when I started reading about 5G rollout in India I found out some hurdles in the way. I have listed them below. 1 Spectrum allocation In India the only band identified for 5G spectrum is under the 3.33.6GHz band which has 300MHz of airwaves available. Of this the defence department has sought 100MHz to boost coastal security while the Isro wants 25MHz for satellitebased navigation services. Source The live mint Okay if that is final then its a big trouble for Telecom companies. You ask why because out of 300MHz 100 goes for defense 25 goes to ISRO then remaining is 175MHz. Which is not enough for all Telecom companies. To make the issue worst TRAI said a single company can buy up to 100MHz out of remaining 175MHz. So hypothetically if Jio with its huge resources buys 100 MHz and Bharti Airtel buys remaining 75MHz there will be no spectrum left for other. 2 Security Concern and Pressure from USA. So you might already know with the Orange clown in White House US and China are locked into this stupid trade war and one of the pressure point US is using to hurt Chinese is the ban on Huawei 5G equipments. US is pressuring all of allies including India to not deploy Huawei equipment for their 5G. Need I remind you Huawei is Baap of 5G technology they are ahead of Samsung Nokia and Cisco in 5G. Huawei equipments are relatively better and economical as compared with others. The security issue with deployment of Huawei equipment in 5G is real and can not be ignored. Yet to be proven but it is believed that Huawei may have backdoors built in their equipment can be used for paying on people and corporate espionage. So far no such issue has come to light. 3 Cash Starved Telecom companies. Indian Telecom companies are starving out of money for past couple of years. To make matters worse in October these companies have been asked to pay over 50000 to Department of Telecommunication as a part of Adjusted Gross Revenue AGR Source Business Standard If they pay that money they wont have enough cash left to pay for upcoming spectrum auctions next year. Given the situation 5G trials and auctions are the furthest things on the mind. We cant participate in 5G auctions and trials. They are nowhere among the top priorities. The trials were clearly on the backburner one senior telecom source Economics Time When the industry is under a death sentence tomorrow looks like the least of your worries. Certainly 5G will be under the cloud of the ability of operators to continue their operations with any reasonable expectations. Rajan Mathews to ET. 4 Some other technical issues Government has decided to reduce power of base station that provide 5G network.The power of 5G stations in was reduced to 0.5 watt as against the conventional base station at 40 watts making it more expensive for telecom companies to have base stations. This means the companies have to create large number of towers or base station that will increase the deployment cost. Conclusion India had missed the 3G and 4G buses by a long margins. If government dont come up with some solution the 5G bus will never come to India. Even if it comes the tickets will not be adorable for huge population.. Signal messenger awareness petition.

Fleet Management Companies Going the Digital Way with Digital Tire Solutions:  With its recently published study Digital Tire Solutions Market in India Drivers Restraints Opportunities Trends and Forecast up to 2025 Infoholic Research forecasts that the Indian market for digital tire solutions will continue to grow due to rising digitalization activities among fleet operators. One of the major trends which will have a vast impact on the automotive market is the development of autonomous vehicles. Much of these developments are implemented in hybrid vehicles with a foresight to make autonomous vehicles a reality. This has led to a rise in the number of sensors per vehicle. To ensure an ecosystem of autonomous cars almost all components of the vehicle should be digitalized including its tires. Most of the Indian states mainly rely on road transport for trade activities which has consequently resulted in a huge number of fleet operators across the country. India has also witnessed an increase in population in cities such as Bengaluru Mumbai Pune Hyderabad Chennai and Delhi mainly due its growing number of working population. This has led to an increase in traveling and road transport is slowly becoming the preferred option among travelers largely due to convenience and availability and to a certain extent for affordability. Tire manufacturers and telematics vendors are trying to gain a considerable market share in the highly potential digitalized tire market in India by releasing fleet management and Tire Pressure Monitoring System TPMS. While telematic vendors are more focused on providing TPMS solutions and mobile apps for monitoring them tire manufacturers are partnering with telecom companies for enabling solutions beyond Bluetoothbased TPMS. Tire manufacturers are focused on providing a total platform which provides more than tire pressure and temperature that includes tire retreading data tire inventory management tire grove measurement for checking tire wearing. For instance Goodyear Proactive Solutions by Goodyear is a set of solutions for fleet operators to resolve tire issues using GPredict which is a predictive analytics technology developed by Goodyear. It includes TPMS for heavy vehicles and offroad vehicles and Goodyear DriveOverReader to measure tread depth load and tire pressure over each tire. For fleet management companies it provides an opportunity to monitor areas including driver safety and fuel efficiency and helps reduce operational costs. An increase in partnerships between tire manufacturers and fleet operators/government transportation agencies/logistics companies is anticipated during the forecast period. However there will be a slow adoption of digital tire solutions by light motor vehicles owners. While a highend automobile may come with advanced tire management system straight out of factory lowend automobile owners will have to get it fitted from a third party. Considering the changes to be made in the vehicle post installation of digital solutions for e.g. wheel alignment must be checked after the installation of TPMS along with the hefty cost and the minimal benefit from its adoption is expected to pull away vehicle owners from implementing digital tire solutions.

During my time working in Pakistan as a medical practitioner I came to realize that the gaping holes in effective doctorpatient communication in the country either stemmed from apathy on the doctors part or a lack of understanding of basic biology in the patients/patients attendants or both. In the light of the above my friend and I have started an initiative which is an attempt to transfer basic understanding of certain diseases explain basic physiology address certain myths that exist in our society about health and diseases and most importantly talk about effective methods to screen common diseases and how to control them before they present with complications.

Why everyone should replace HDDs with SSDs in their laptops/PCs..: Slow laptops are a common problem everyone deals with in India and especially those who use old laptops. Buying laptops that cost more than 4550k makes no sense for students and for those who cant afford that much. The easiest solution to turn your laptop into a super fast beast is to upgrade to a Solid State Drive SSD. In simple words SSDs have no moving parts like hard disks and their read/write speed is superior which boots your laptop in less than 10 seconds and launches applications much quicker. Process of upgrading is moderately easy. It requires you to access the hard disk of your laptop. First you should clone copy your new SSD with everything from the HDD. Then remove the HDD and install your new SSD. There are so many tutorials available if you want to DIY. They are relatively inexpensive considering how big an upgrade it is. Here are some popular SSDs [Crucial 240 GB]https//www.amazon.in/dp/B07G3KRZBX/refcmswrcpapaiDngPDbD015R05 [Crucial 500 GB]https//www.amazon.in/dp/B0786QNS9B/refcmswrcpapaiHogPDbFT291RZ [Samsung Evo 240 GB]https//www.amazon.in/dp/B079DTMNWC/refcmswrcpapaimqgPDbCEKDXS2.

Social Media marketing trends 2020: Take a look at what we believe are the key social media marketing trends for 2020 that marketers need to be aware of in order to ensure their marketing strategy is uptodate and as effective as possible. Social media has now become synonymous with digital marketing going handinhand with most if not all digital campaigns. However social media is far from static and what worked a few months ago may not get you the same good results now. Habits change platforms evolve and new platforms come into existence. All of this influences how people use and react to social media marketing as well as how marketers are able to reach their audience. It is more important than ever before for marketers to understand and stay ahead of the curve when it comes to social media. Doing so ensures you have the right tools at your disposal an uptodate strategy and the required skills to make the most of social media. With this in mind weve taken a look at some of the trends that we believe are going to be important when it comes to social media marketing in 2020. Here are the trends that we and other experts think you need to be aware of ahead of the new year The digital detox There are now 3.484 billion social media users across the globe which is a 9 increase compared to last year. This equates to 45 of the worlds population being on social media. It also means that social media adoption has actually beaten previous estimates which suggested that an estimated 2.82 billion would be using social media in 2019. While this suggests that brands have the opportunity to reach larger audiences than ever before a new trend is affecting that audience base. Digital around the world 2019 More people are now choosing to detox from social media deleting apps and profiles in order to step away from it. This is more than just the usual changes we see in terms of people choosing to use one platform less in favour of another such as Facebook seeing users decline but Instagram attracting more this trend is seeing people take a temporary or permanent break from all social media. One in three adults in the UK are now reducing their social media use. Some 6 of users have removed an app from their phone 6 have permanently deleted their accounts and 8 have both deleted their accounts and removed social media mobile apps. Digital detox stats A big reason for this is that people now feel overloaded by social media with the permeation of social media affecting their mental health and wellbeing. Others choose to detox because they dont trust social media platforms either due to issues like Fake News or because of privacy and data concerns. I think that this year well be seeing more of a change in the way social media users act online I think that digital detox will become more prevalent this year with many people trying to limit the amount of time they spend on social media. I also think that there will continue to be a big push towards making social media more private and secure for its users this has been a big problem recently and many people are just realizing how truly dangerous a lack of online privacy can be. And these things of course will have a big impact on marketing too brands and marketers need to be on top of these trends and act accordingly. Lilach Bullock Content marketing and social media specialist. This isnt to say that social media will become void in terms of digital marketing but marketers do need to understand the impacts it could have. When added to the issues that paytoplay social media brings more people taking on a digital detox whether temporary or permanent will impact reach and engagement of your posts. This can affect the results of any customer acquisition or brand awareness campaigns you launch across social media platforms. Ultimately its vital that you dont start putting all your marketing eggs in the social media bucket. You need to ensure that enough budget and resource is still being given to other channels including email marketing and search engine marketing. However its also vital that you ensure that any social media presence you do have is as meaningful as possible. Your brand needs to offer more than memes you need to deliver content that has a positive and memorable impact on your audience and that provides as much value as possible. Building social media communities A big part of meaningful and valuable experiences on social media is the way that brands engage with their audience. While sharing posts that you believe your target audience will enjoy is part of maintaining your social media presence you also need to encourage and cultivate interactions that are more than a simple like or share. There are a lot of brands out there who seemingly have large social media followings and yet when you look more closely at individual posts their engagement levels are almost nonexistent. Those brands that are seeing more engagement from their followers are doing so by building communities around their content. Smart Insights Facebook Members Community This isnt to say that communities are a new concept but they are being built by brands in different ways which is paying off and will likely continue to do so as we head into 2020. While social communities arent a new concept how brands build them is changing the way we interact with them. There are many brands both B2C and B2B that have massive followings with no real engagement. The bottom line is your online presence should expand your reach to ultimately drive more conversions. For starters its crucial to measure your efforts and stay in touch with your audience. Social media suites are a great way to see everything in one place from post creation and distribution to monitoring and analytics. Figure out whats working and whats not dont be afraid to pivot and try something new Encourage your team to create their own social presence to promote content and increase overall brand trust. This tactic leads to an authentic voice for your company Twitter chats help create a strong sense of community through content bringing thought leaders from all areas together in a realtime conversation. It gives your brand the perfect opportunity to engage directly with current and potential customers. More than ever before potential buyers want to hear from current customers so give them a place to do just that. Bridget Poetker Senior Content Marketing Specialist at G2 Building social media communities away from your profiles is just the start after all creating a group and having people join is no guarantee that they will engage. You also need to create content that gets them talking encourages conversations and cultivates that feeling of community. Doing so can keep people engaged with your brand but also bring in new leads and customers while also adding a human personalized element to your brand. I believe that the days of merely posting content and people showing up to engage are slowly coming to an end as paytoplay social media becomes more and more prevalent with every social network over time. As a company youre already at a disadvantage which is why it will become more important than ever to actually engage with your community. Im not talking about engagement so that your content shows up better in the algorithm but actually thanking those people in your community not only when they comment or engage with your content but actually proactively reaching out to them like a social media user would reach out to a friend. If your business wants to survive in organic social media in 2020 I believe that this sort of humanization of your brand will be necessary. Neal Schaffer Leading Global Educator and effective implementer of social media strategy for business. Social media influencers and wordofmouth marketing One benefit of building social media communities is the fact that they help with wordofmouth marketing which is another big social media marketing trend for 2020. Communities allow you to engage with nano or microinfluencers who are already advocates of your brand in order to get them to share honest views and experiences of your products or services. We all know that influencers have been around for a while and they have now become an expected part of the social media experience. They can offer great benefits for brands including a relatively high earned media value especially now that Instagram usage is continuing to grow at an elevated rate. Influencer marketing average earned media spend However many types of influencers are no longer trusted by consumers. Big influencers are not only expensive for brands they no longer have the impact that they used to because they are seen as disingenuous. In fact 61 of consumers will trust the recommendations of friends and family over celebrity endorsements because they are more likely to be honest. In comparison smaller influencers such as those who are likely to be part of your communities tend to have better relationships with their followers which means they benefit from a higher level of trust. This can lead to more engagement at a lower cost as well as increased trust in a brand that is more likely to culminate in conversion. Instagram and Twitter engagement rate A good reason to follow my advice on social media communities is that this will also make it much easier for your brand to engage with influencers in 2020. This obviously is the other way to incite Word of Mouth marketing on social media when organic social media for businesses is pretty much dead. Now Im not talking about spending thousands of dollars and reaching out to celebrities who are promoting one brand today and another brand tomorrow. Im talking about authentically engaging with those in your community who are already following you and are already nano if not microinfluencers and finding a way to collaborate with them. I am so passionate about this subject that it is going to be the focal point of my next book Age of Influence which publishes in March of 2020 but needless to say I hope that marketers in 2020 will realize that social media is not just a place to market to people but really is the ultimate forum for you to find and collaborate with a variety of social media users of varying influence that can help push your marketing objectives forward. Neal Schaffer Leading Global Educator and effective implementer of social media strategy for business. Taking on nano or microinfluencers as brand ambassadors means that they can share posts about your brand but also engage in conversions with their highly engaged following or others within communities. It is these conversations that are more likely to influence buying decisions and help build trust in your company. This type of marketing creates positive brand sentiment gets people talking about your brand and provides more insights into consumers buying behaviour and pain points. All of this better enables you to create a genuine experience for your audience. The rise of alternative platforms Facebook Twitter and Instagram tend to be the core platforms used by B2C brands with LinkedIn also being vital for B2B companies. However many users are growing fatigued with these core platforms while brands have to fight harder than ever before to achieve good levels of organic reach and engagement. While Twitter has seen growth so far this year its active user numbers have declined from its alltime 2017 high. Similarly Facebook has seen a huge drop in users especially younger users over the last two years with younger audiences opting to spend time on other platforms. Combined with the increasing paytoplay format of social media channels this means that brands arent seeing the results on these platforms that they previously did. Twitter monthly average users [Average monthly Twitter users by year] One social media platform that is becoming a goto especially for younger generations is TikTok. While the app was launched in 2016 its popularity has grown fairly recently with 2019 seeing a huge number of users flock to the platform. It now has around 500 million monthly active users worldwide and registered more than 1.1 billion installs as of March 2019. Active monthly TikTok users While TikTok is unlikely to be the best option for B2B brands B2C companies with a younger target audience 41 of TikTok users are aged between 16 and 24 could find it to be a great platform to encourage engagement with users who are stepping away from more traditional social media platforms. As well as TikTok a good platform to invest in for those looking to encourage ecommerce sales through social media could be Pinterest. Although Pinterest is far from new on the scene it has experienced a recent resurgence meaning it is now used for more than just saving recipes or getting decorating inspiration. Pinterest has found that it fits well into the ecommerce space and has an audience that is engaged with the idea of buying products they see on the platform. In fact 75 of Pinterest users say they are very interested in new products compared to just 55 of people on other social media platforms. This is likely why retail brands are finding success on the platform with them reporting 2x higher returns on ad spend from the platform than other forms of social media and a 1.3x higher return than traditional search. Since Instagram as an ecommerce platform is getting harder to gain customers from marketers will highly likely move to Pinterest. Pinterest now resembles Instagram when the latter emerged. No obtrusive ads userfriendly search engine and no fake influencers. More than 250 million people use Pinterest every month and this number will increase. Speaking of TikTok this platform keeps growing very rapidly. Marketers and business owners whose target audience are teenagers and young people should definitely consider TikTok as a winning marketing platform. TikTok is already an attractive platform for YouTube Instagram and Twitch bloggers since its effortless and fun to make videos and gain fame there..

App Idea for Microfunding Indian Redditors are amazingly intelligent and honest but I wish we could help each other like family in terms of finances.: TLDR Can we create a way to microfund the person in need who says I need Rs 6000 for my PG while I look for a job in a new city. I need a microfunding of Rs 5 per person from 1200 people Rs 5 multiplied by 1200 donors. 3 months later when I earn enough money with my job I will return Rs 9000 to all those who microfunded me. So basically you gave him Rs 5 but now you will get around Rs 8. Something that does not matter to you but gave freedom to that guy in real need. This way you can earn around Rs 500 in a month coming from such interest and so many people will gain freedom. Now the long story. Here is the problem Lets say I earn 30000 per month. My real brother calls me up and says he needs Rs 15000 per month for next 4 months. I will send him without any questions asked. Because I trust him that he will not spend it on unnecessary things and will try his best to get a job and then return the extra money. But now if a Redditor or someone on internet asks me for such help like 15k per month I will not help him. Now there is a reason for my rejection The reason is that giving 15k to a person I do not trust is simply impractical. I can send him Rs 10 at most. That too if there is some guarantee that this guy will return my Rs 10 with a 10 interest which means 3 months later I will get Rs 11. I know one rupee is too less but even generous human brains today have been wired to How will I benefit from this charity I know this guy can manipulate it by running away with Rs 6000 and never returning it. But we can fix the risk of such manipulation if the App sends the Phone Number of the guy to the police and police tracks him down. Please comment your insights and whether such project already exists in India. Justdial manipulates reviews.: I have had bad experiences with some professionals where they didnt really completed their commitments to any extent whatsover. These are doctors hypnotists etc. I have gone to them by looking at Justdial reviews well they were all above 4.5 out of 5. To my experience I gave them the bad review. Then came this manipulation in picture. First they called me to remove my review. I told them I wont as the said person is doing fraud in some way. Then they removed it from backend. Me being obsessive put that again. Then they put me on line with the professional. She asked me to put that review down I denied obviously. The lady cursed me literally. Anyways that review was taken down by Justdial. This happened again with a doctor who happened to cause me a lot of sufferings. So now I am skeptical about reviews especially from Justdial. They just keep the best reviews of clients or may even have created them. Anyone else has such experiences. Indias Vishnu Nandan among 300 researchers to join largest ever Arctic expedition.

Perceived Stress Scale survey for r/india: Hi fellow r/indians I have created a Google Forms survey based on the Perceived Stress Scale https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PerceivedStressScalewprovsfla1 which is a widely used metric to asses the how stressed individuals are. Studies have shown it to be a reliable measure of stress and it also predicts depression smoking use and objective biological markers of stress among other things. Ive tried finding PSS surveys on Indians but have only come up with academic surveys in some colleges which showed that students studying in medical and other colleges have higher stress levels. I know this subreddit is definitely not a good sample for India as a whole. Also it is true that to translate the test into other languages one needs to be careful since the way the questions are worded impacts how people respond. Nonetheless I would be very thankful if you all take some time out of your schedule and fill out the anonymous Google form below. Your identity and email will remain anonymous though you have to use a Google account to limit multiple submissions by the same account to fill it. It will atleast give us enough data to find how r/India compares with the mean stress levels in countries like USA. Mental health in India is very low on anyones priorities and to help change the situation we need data first more than anything. I will post the results of the survey in the coming weeks along with any interesting finds I get after doing a statistical analysis. Please feel free to pm me if you need any more information on the methodology.

Need Advice from Software Engineers: Hello everyone I am a college fresher working as an application supports engineer for past 3 months in a Decent MNC . My job is half as software engineer and half technical support switched on month basis. But I always wanted to be software engineer Not application support engineer. I was recruited though campus placement so seeing people around me getting placed and pressure of having job after college I ended up in this company. Apart from that. I am working in Bangalore. As you all know this city is among the costliest cities in India. The culture the feel is just different. I feel very alone here I always stay in a small closed room because there is nobody out there. But this city is know as silicon valley of India. The city is full with working professionals and there is a huge scope of career development. Now lets talk about Gurgaon where Ive few friends good transport facility a very convenient city . The best advantage which I really want is my home thats just 100 kms away from this city BTW the distance from Bangalore to my city is 2000 km . I will be able to visit my home once/twice a monthchill and spend more time with my family But the problem is Gurgaon doesnt have that much scope till now that Bangalore has. But still there are many companies and startups more than enough to get job. Gurgaon is on its way be become the next IT hub in India. I dont want to stay in my current company. Lets say I work there for 2 yearsas a Depressed guy then my experience with software development will just be 1 year. But salary in a Starup will surely be less than where I am working but Gurgaon is cheaper than Bangalore. Question is what should I do Should I move to Gurgaon which I want right now and work with less salary in a startup or stay in the current company or apply for other companies in Bangalore.

This App Will Paint Your Home in 1 SECOND.. Big billion day and Amazon great Indian sale: The Biggest Sale of the year is here Flipkarts Big Billion Days. The Big Billion Days Sale will start from September 29th and we have some of the top shopping hacks that would help shoppers grab maximum benefits during this years online sale season. 1. Use Card offers Even if you do not have a specific credit or debit card use websites like [usemycards.com]https//usemycards.com where you can find cardholders and they would order for you 2. Check Price History Sale or no sale a mere glance at the price graph of a particular product could be an eyeopener. There is nothing new about most ecommerce platforms hiking the price of products a few weeks or months before the grand sale and bringing it back to the same price during the sale. But instead of taking a holy oath to never shop during a sale again shoppers can try price comparison tools like [Buyhatke]https//chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/buyhatke/ojplmecpdpgccookcobabopnaifgidhfhlen MySmartPrice to check price history of the products they wish to buy. Using these tools is no rocket science just check whether or not the deduction in the price is genuine. If its genuine go right ahead with the purchase. If not set a price alert to buy it for the best price in the future. 3. Use No cost EMI option or Pay Later on Flipkart Flipkart and Amazon recently launched the option for shoppers to pay for the product later if they cannot afford to pay right away. However the Pay Later option has credit limit which increases or decreases based on how timely the repayments have been made. So shoppers need to make sure their Pay Later repayments are always on time so that they can shop more expensive products during the sale. 4. Look for the Best Price Most shoppers just assume that the product listed on a sale is the best price they can get for it which may not be true. Different ecommerce platforms have different profit margins for different products which is why it is quite possible to find a better price for the product even when it is listed on a grand sale. But shoppers can make sure they are looking at the best price with the help of price comparison websites like Buyhatke SmartPrix PriceCheckIndia etc. 5. Apply Coupon Codes Applying a coupon code is never the problem. The problem begins when the shopper has to swim through an ocean of coupons to find that one coupon which gets them the discount. And that is comparable to finding a needle in a haystack. So a shopper finds it safe to assume that there are no available coupons for them. And while most shoppers would continue with their assumption there are browser plugins like Buyhatke that find and apply all the coupons a shopper is eligible for even the hidden ones at the cart checkout. It is understandable that coupon codes could be a headache but finding the right coupons always pays off. 6. Look for Gift Card Discounts Not many shoppers go the extra mile to find additional discount especially when the additional discount is extra difficult to find. Also one doesnt know what they dont know. For instance not many shoppers know that there are platforms like Buyhatke Gift Cards Cardpool Woohoo.in and more that allow shoppers to purchase ecommerce store gift cards at discounted rates. For example one can purchase gift cards at a flat 3 discount on Buyhatke. So these were some of the top hacks that shoppers can use this sale season to shop smarter than ever. Shopping whether out of fun or necessity is something one cannot avoid. However what can be avoided is spending more than they should. Happy Shopping. Tech News 051.

An open source data platform for Indian Smart Cities: ampx200B https//i.redd.it/f8n1ru0ueso31.jpg All of us face so many issues in our cities. Be it congestion crater like potholes on our roads mismanaged traffic unreliable public transportation and I can just go on and on. While our cities breathe they emit a lot of valuable data that most of the time goes unnoticed and to waste. Being a data scientist I can see what this data could do to mitigate all the issues listed above but unfortunately this data never reaches the people who can innovate and build solutions around it. My startup is building an open source data exchange platform with a focus on high velocity or realtime data for smart cities. Our aim is to bring public entities closer to data innovators and application developers. This would enable easy access to realtime datasets like public bus location air quality and much more in the future. Getting realtime bus location data from any supported city is as easy as from meshgtfsr.mesh import MeshGTFSR def main m MeshGTFSR feed m.subscribe[ /in/delhi ] You get feed in f and geospace in g for f g in feed printGeospace g printFeed strf if main name main You can learn more about the platform on our github page [https//github.com/pravahio/gomesh]https//github.com/pravahio/gomesh If you resonate with the idea lets chat and see how we can collaborate. Platform and the data are completely free. Give it a try and do let me know your feedback. I would be happy to incorporate you suggestions. If you are feeling too excited about the platform we are looking for contributors. Send me a message and lets talk.

Facing up to reality Given its achievements ISRO should not hide setbacks with the cellophane of national pride:  [https//www.thehindu.com/opinion/oped/facinguptoreality/article29385210.ece]https//www.thehindu.com/opinion/oped/facinguptoreality/article29385210.ece gtLess than 24 hours after ISRO Chairman K. Sivan made it apparent that the Vikram lander had ceased to touch down on predicted lines Vikram went from being the heart of the mission to being only 5 of the missions objectives. We have already done 9095 of the technology demonstration Mr. Sivan said. Why Rover was important for India gtChandrayaan2 was initially conceived as a collaborative mission between India and Russia. India was to make the orbiter spacecraft and launch by GSLV and Russia was to provide the lander and rover. Russia then said that it would only provide the lander. Later Russia pulled out of the mission and India ultimately decided to design a lander and rover on its own. This delayed the Chandrayaan2 mission by nearly four years and advanced Indias Mars mission. Therefore its hard to understand how such an iconic module that shows Indias ability to design a space vehicle suddenly became only 5 of the overall mission objective. With its special sauce rover missing whats different now from Chandrayaan1 gtThe key difference is that Chandrayaan2 propelled by the GSLV MkIII rocket went all the way into a lunar orbit. This proved that ISRO had mastered the nuances of the cryogenic engine which allows rockets capable of carrying heavier payloads to be designed. A rarefied club gtIt needs to be underlined that India for decades has been part of a rarefied space club that consists of only a handful of countries capable of launching homemade satellite aboard homegrown rockets. Therefore the only real pressure that ISRO faced with Chandrayaan2 was to conform to social mediafuelled national pride. gtISROs successes are built on the altar of multiple failures improved over five decades. It still has a long way to go from successfully grooming a private sector industry capable of providing many more jobs to ensuring that it maintains its meritocratic work culture and ability to hire talented engineers who can be invested in its work. gt gtWhile getting the world to share in its success is important ISRO only needs to explain its setbacks not hide them with the cellophane of national pride..

Not all space agencies can connect with the general population as has Isro take China National Space Administration or Roscosmos for example. Given that majority of Indian population is young and now ever more connected through internet this mission has captured the imagination of country like never before. Though not meeting the target of soft landing the message which has gone to the country is highly positive and this will have a long reaching benefits for the Isro and science in India in general. Not all science field can be glamorized as space science but government should consider using media to promote achievements in other field which in long term will bring in more talent into STEM and will be the helpful in developing the talent pool for the country..

Virat Hindu Sherni wants ISRO to rule other galaxies too before 2030 and that can be done by increased funding. Watch out aliens ISRO incoming.. Weird thought but heres a reason why Vikram got crash landed: So every probe which lands on another planet has basically a device fitted inside it which measures its height from the surface. So lets say what Vikram was actually measuring was not the height from the surface but the height from a crater. The craters on moon are as wide as over 93 km wide and deep and so it was aiming to land at the depth of crater rather than surface and eventually got crashed at its slope the time when we lost communication. Same thing happened with Israels moon mission they lost the signal over just .15 km above surface. Heres why this might be the reason The initial landing wa scheduled at 117 AM. It got stretched to 155 AM which is not normal India landed its probe on Mars so we are efficient enough to land on moon plus given that we did everything perfectly before communication loss it shows were efficient.

Jubilation turned to despair early Saturday morning as the Chandrayaan2 lander lost contact with Earth minutes before it was to land on the Moon. However isro has said they are currently not in a position to confirm that the mission is failed.. Reflection post Mission Chandrayaan 2: Its hard to see after so much anticipation that we couldnt reach the mark. This would be a remarkable takeaway for ISRO and for its quest in doing something valuable for the country. The mission was allocated at a cost of Rs 978 crores which is around 141 Million dollars. The prime minister was there consoling the scientists. Social media has been supportive. Every citizen has backed them And we continue to do. The PM mentioned the moment when the announcement was made that they had lost communication the scientists received a major shock. The Pm consoled them and the emotional Chairman Mr K Sivan which was heart breaking to watch ..Mahn that for me shows the amount of dedication our intelligent minds put to explore the world. This as I mentioned will be a major takeaway. ISRO is still trying to access communication and we hope for the best as always. Some have said that the whole mission should had undergone in secrecy and others object to it by saying that it takes a lot of courage to show your failures. There were also people who commented on the downfall of the economy stating that India should get its priorities right. We as a nations intellectual minds proceed relentlessly towards development and major breakthroughs in the STEM field.

Understanding The Business Concept When you are at the starting point of your web agency what you are required to consider is about the concept of the business why you are going to start with it and what will be the future peak points that you might be needing to ace the race when faced with competitions of scaling it high and reaping utmost revenue from it. For this you must go through screening your competitors after you have evaluated the business ideals and what it requires for you to become another horse in the race Understand Your Clients Once you have stopped at the edge of something the foremost thing that you must notice and bring to your concern is who is going to be your audience whom you will target and how are you going to convert them into your clients. Good communication good clarity of business objectives deadline meetups quantity and quality of work and also the perfect coincidence of wants between the provider and the gainer is equally important. You will first have to find who are suitable for targeting and then know how to satisfy them Marketing Your Business While you are busy with maintaining client relationships there is another factor that might be wrenching your attention and that is marketing or producing sales from your own business. You cannot leave behind your entity while satisfying your clients. Both of the tasks at a uniform pace is utmost important.

Another core eligibility to become a good website is to bring about good content in the website which is not only easy to read understand and roll your eyes through but one which recites the business stories to its audience just like a fairytale backed by profound development expertise Professional Connectivity When you are good you deserve to be heard and spelt out That is made possible only through professional connections that are made through testimonials or reviews that come from clients for whom you have worked and gather remarks for the work done. It speaks genuinely about the real people and gets you referrals if you have sets of good remarks from the former not only based on the quality of your work but many other factors like communication teamwork ethics and many more.

No gaming. My top priority question Considering advancement in Android memory footprint of newer apps power/RAMmanagement features of newer Android versions is 4 GB RAM enough in this era Other things to consider Camera Undecided I dont take many pics but it is important. AFAIK both have the same sensor but how is postprocessing I do not care about selfies. Audio Realme X I saw that Realme has Dolby Atmos so kinda leaning towards it Screen Realme X I have never used anything with a notch so far so Im not sure how Im going to feel about notch of RN7P. Battery Realme X RN7P has a bigger battery but RX has a fast charger inbox. SoC I dont care as long as it gives fluid experience. \add something if there is anything else to consider\ So in the end I am stuck because of the camera and the topic of memory requirement/management. Help me with it Did I pick the correct device in the rest of the categories Considering Vivo Z1 Pro on the side. It has a much bigger battery with 18 W charger amp a newer SoC. However I cannot stand microUSB amp Im unsure about its camera from various reviews. But let me know if you think its pros outweigh the effing microUSB I dont know why I hate it. Or is there any upcoming phone within my price range around 15k I was very interested in upcoming Mi A3 but 720p AMOLED is painful. I had smaller AMOLED screens and over 5 inches it was okay at best. 6 inches is meh. I have checked several Samsung phones and I have decided against them for various reasons VFM past experience. Still if you have a strong recommendation for a Samsung phone let me know. Thanks. Isnt This Amazing.

Expectation vs reality Friends. Tips and Advice for engineers in Tech Field: I want to start this by saying that I am still in my final year of engineering and by no means all of which is written here the only path to succeed in the field. This is just a handful of resources and bits of advice which I wished I had received during my early years of engineering. So Ive got into engineering where do I start ampx200B Start by exploring the field. The technology domain is very vast and has a wide variety of options. The first 2 years of your engineering years should be exploring the options that this field provides.Not a hard and fast rule but this time period should be adequate enough for you to find something of your interest In future you wouldnt want to end up doing something that you dont like have no interest in or simply have no knowledge about. But I have no passion/interest for anything just here coz of the ampx200B No worries in time maybe even at the end of your third year youll definitely find something interesting. If not no worries still just make sure youre alright with all the concepts of Data structures OOPS ObjectOriented Programming Databases and Networking. Basic knowledge of these subjects will always help you land a job and maybe after getting a job youll know what you want to do. Choose a programming language ampx200B Oh this might seem a bit of obvious advice but Ive seen people my batch mates going absolutely overboard with learning every new language that comes up. Surely this will help widen your area of knowledge but youll be stuck with writing Hello World and declaring arrays and all those basic concepts. At max have a handy knowledge of 2 languages. My advice is Java and Python. Most of the software systems are still running Java and companies are always on a look out for Java freshers and experts. So if you hear anyone say that Java is dying and soon will be replaced tell them to take their jokes somewhere else. Python is very easy to learn has almost pseudocode type of syntax and is still a very powerful language. Surely it is slow as compared to Java but with the third party modules and libraries and a great community support learning python will be a delightful experience Get your concepts of data structures and OOPS very clear ampx200B I cannot stress over how important is data structures and OOPS if you want to have a career in the tech industry. Ive given interviews for over 15 companies in over a month now and each and every one of them will test out your knowledge of DS. Also have a good knowledge of dynamic programming graphs and trees and pattern matching. OOPS concepts also play a very important role in landing you a job or even in your future higher studies. Have a clear mind on what abstraction polymorphism Inheritance and Encapsulation is and why theyre important. Where do I start learning these ampx200B The college/university curriculum will have a introductory low level language which will help you get started with coding. But Ive noticed that the professors of such courses merely run through the presentations and just want you to rot the code during lectures and spit them out during lab sessions. This will just be a waste of time and youll learn nothing productive other than enhancing your ctrlc and ctrlv skills. My suggestion is [New Bostons Tutorials]https//www.youtube.com/watchv2NWeucMKrLIamplistPL6gx4Cwl9DGAKIXv8Yr6nhGJ9Vlcjyymq only if youre starting out. The guy is knowledgeable teaches well and does all of this while still keeping the videos short and funny. Now that you have some basic knowledge about programming lets consolidate those The number 1 advice youll receive from any programmer is PRACTICE. And you know what theyre not wrong. Practice practice and some more practice will help you become a better programmer. Theres no shortcut to this unfortunately. Now I dont recommend solving x number of problems in a month as a way to become a better programmer it certainly works but NOT for a lot of people but what I do recommend is 6090 minutes of coding daily. This is way harder than fulfilling a quota of x no. of problems in a week/month and will require constant effort. You wont see the results immediately not even in month or two but 68 months down the line youll be a better programmer than what you were when you started. Where do I practice ampx200B There are a ton of websites where you could practice your skills but I like HackerRank the most just because it is more beginnerfriendly and has a decent UI Competitive Programming Test Sites 1.

Ive been there trying not to copy codes and write my own but failed after a two weeks. What I do suggest is when youre in a situation where it is absolutely necessary to copy code like say lab assignment submission just try not to select the whole thing and copy paste into an editor/IDE and submitting. Instead type out the code. Yes keep the tab where youre copying from open and type out the code. Also comment on it even if it means copying the comment already made on the internet available code. This will certainly take more time and effort but subconsciously your brain will remember things if youre a little focused and concentrated and maybe in future you might be able to code some part of it on your own. Get into the habit of commenting on any piece of code that you write. At first it may seem to be a waste of time and would also unnecessarily increase the length of your code but in the long run whenever you revisit your old codes either for refactoring or to reuse it youll be thankful that you commented it. Now commenting does not mean you comment on each and every line of your code and describe what it does. Just comment whenever you declare a new function and class and in 10 words or less describe what it does. At times there will be a certain piece of code youd want to comment on because it was new for you or complex enough for you to not remember what it did. Indent your code Indent your code even when the language syntax does not require it. Make sure your code is readable for anyone even having a glance on it. Theres no point in saving lines and comparing whos code is shorter when two of you have written the same thing. Do not get intimidated by fast learners/knowitall This will probably be a very fatal mistake to make. Never be afraid of asking for help either online or in person. Learn things at your own pace and keep putting constant effort into things. Learn to read documentation Oh the amount of stress and the number of google searches that youll save only if youve learnt how to read the documentations. Almost 90 of the problems/errors youll face in your undergraduate years will be solved if you know how to read and implement the documentation info. This will be a very challenging task and 100 of the times you would want to just close the tab and just StackOverflow your doubt but just a little more effort will help you in the long run. Optimizing the code This will by far be the most challenging thing youll do in your entire engineering period. OPTIMIZING. Optimizing your code will certainly a hell lot of practice research and reading but it can be the most rewarding thing if done correctly. Theres not shortcut to learning this skill and no direct way to learn it either. Youll only learn it when you write code. If you want to see how you have learnt optimizing your code return to a problem that you solved earlier When you started out coding vs when you have been coding for 68 months continuously. Get into a habit of reading PDFs from mobile and desktops without getting distracted Pretty much what it says. Youll have to be referring to a lot of books if you want a deeper understanding of a subject. And most of the times your library will not have the latest edition of the required book or the book will be too expensive to purchase. Find the latest edition of the book on [PDFdrive.net]https//pdfdrive.net/ and start reading. Internships gt Projects gt Certifications Simply what the title says. If youre not able to secure internships try doing projects on the domain youre interested in or in any domain. Mind you these preferably should be personal projects and not academic the ones you do during your semester. Certifications from Udemy are pretty much worthless. Certifications of courses that are offered by big universities Stanford Harvard Cornell etc are much more valuable. Some general advice for everyone in Engineering Your networking and communication skills are as much important as your domain knowledge or expertise. Do not neglect this skill in any way. What good is your knowledge if you cant ELI5 it to others ampx200B Do something in your free time. And by something I dont mean scroll through reddit or Instagram or binge watch TV series all day. This is very debatable but Ill let it stay. ampx200B Keep your GPA at least above average. What good your knowledge and expertise will do if you arent eligible to sit for a companys interview or secure a seat in a good foreign university. Again not saying it should be 10/10 or 4/4 but a decent number. ampx200B Join clubs/committees in college theyre a great way to enhance your social skills and theyre probably the best way to learn how to not manage a group of people. ampx200B Try not to get backlogs Again very debatable and willing to discuss. ampx200B Keep your internships industry relevant. Theres no point in doing a sales and marketing internship if you want to make a career in the tech field. Keep your internships relevant and try not to accept unpaid positions. ampx200B If youre in a tier3 or even a tier2 college chances are 90 of the professors will just run through slides and ppts just reading whatever is written on them. Sit on the last benches open your phone and just do something you like.

How can I learn Artificial Intelligence and Machine sitting at home specially in INDIA:  what is the exact process First things first the prerequisites Basic calculus. In Machine Learning youd be working on a lot of optimizations that require knowledge of Calculus. It would be highly recommended that you are aware of functions limits differentiation maxima minima etc. Linear Algebra. When you talk about ML you will be dealing with matrices and vectors every day. So knowledge of Linear Algebra is a must. However youd also be required to know about other important topics like Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors. Probability. Most ML algorithms try to model the underlying phenomena that generated the observed data. All of this modelling is probabilistic. It is therefore highly recommended that you are comfortable with the theory of Probability. Getting into actual ML Take a great online course on ML. It is a great course and it teaches you the basics of Machine Learning Regression classification various ML algorithms etc. The course also requires you to build a digit recognition system. Once you have the basics in place it would be a great idea to practice some problems on. Kaggle is a wellknown Machine Learning contest platform where you can compete with others in training ML models on various datasets. Take up ML projects. This is the most important point. Ideally youd want to have not only ML experience but also some great projects on your resume that you can showcase. These projects will help you distinguish yourself from other candidates. After searching a lot for courses that teach ML through projects https//i.redd.it/saoqhc1y31e31.png Source Google going with the trends and keeping our busy schedules in mind we can opt for online learning through various online portals which provide interesting packages and offers and here are some of the advantage of going with the online format Flexibility\ you can go through the course and easily complete the course when you have free time and are fresh to learn and gain knowledge Dynamic\ you can view the videos of the course on multiple devices like your phone laptop PC Lower total costs Online programs prove a more affordable option than traditional colleges.

What is the Technology behind FaceApp and is your face safe with them:  What is FaceApp FaceApp is relatively new to the Android and iOS mobile app scene only starting in 2017. It falls under the Photo amp Video category on both Google Play and the App Store. If youre searching for it now you wont miss it. The app rose to fame in August 2017 soon after its initial launch by boasting its powerful facial recognition capabilities enabled by artificial intelligence. However the app came under fire for featuring ethnicity filters to change a users skin tone. This sparked controversy and the developers quickly pulled the filters from the app. FaceApp lost most of its fame until now. The technology behind FaceApp Its been a few years since weve seen FaceApp making headlines so its worth checking out some of the advancements theyve made since then. I ran a picture of myself through the app and used the old age filter since its currently trending. Right away you can see the power of FaceApps photorealistic transformation but how exactly does Wireless Lab achieve this somewhat creepy level of realism Through image recognition software. In simple terms image recognition utilizes deep learning technology to recognize the key features of the human face. Think of Snapchat filters but on a much more advanced level. ampx200B ampx200B https//i.redd.it/krw9dssyt0e31.png If youre not sure what deep learning is just know its the most advanced type of machine learning today. Using deep learning image recognition feeds sample data through deep neural networks to learn all the nuances of the human face. The sample data in the case of FaceApp are pictures of me your friends your family celebrities and essentially everyone who has allowed the mobile app to access their camera rolls. For deep learning the more sample data that is run through the neural network the more accurate it gets at generating those hyperrealistic old age photos youre seeing across social media. What else can FaceApp do Refining a neural network takes time resources and deep knowledge. Its clear the FaceApp team has some talent. So what else can the app do Scrolling through the app you can see there are many imagemanipulation options. For example users can apply eyeshadow and lipstick change hair colour and style add beards and moustaches even add accessories and alter facial expressions. FaceApp even recognizes when a photo of a man has been uploaded versus that of a woman. Pretty intricate stuff. So whats the problem Eyebrows were raised lately when app developer Joshua Nozzi tweeted that FaceApp was uploading troves of photos from peoples smartphones without asking permission. However a French cybersecurity researcher who uses the pseudonym Elliot Alderson investigated Mr Nozzis claims. He found that no such bulk uploading was going on FaceApp was only taking the specific photos users decided to submit. FaceApp also confirmed to the BBC that only the usersubmitted photo is uploaded. What about facial recognition Others have speculated that FaceApp may use data gathered from user photos to train facial recognition algorithms. This can be done even after the photos themselves are deleted because measurements of features on a persons face can be extracted and used for such purposes. No we dont use photos for facial recognition training the firms chief executive Yaroslav Goncharov told BBC News. Only for editing pictures. Is that it Not quite. Some question why FaceApp needs to upload photos at all when the app could in theory just process images locally on smartphones rather than send them to the cloud. In FaceApps case the server that stores user photos is located in the US. FaceApp itself is a Russian company with offices in St Petersburg. Cybersecurity researcher Jane Manchun Wong tweeted that this may simply give FaceApp a competitive advantage it is harder for others developing similar apps to see how the algorithms work. Steven Murdoch at University College London agreed. It would be better for privacy to process the photos on the smartphone itself but it would be likely \[to be\] slower use more battery power and make it easier for the FaceApp technology to be stolen he told BBC News. US lawyer Elizabeth Potts Weinstein argued the apps terms and conditions suggested user photos could be used for commercial purposes such as FaceApps own ads..

What is the Future of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in INDIA:  A news report published in October in The Economic Times said Startups witness 108 growth in funding in India in 2018. The news report further mentioned that Artificial Intelligence was among those domains which witnessed the fastest adoption among industry sectors. Currently there are about 400 startups working on AI and machine learning domains. About 150 million dollars is invested in Indias AI sector by private players alone and the number has been growing since 2016. Though there has been growth India lags far behind countries like the US and China in terms of investment. With a copious pool of STEM talent and with a growing population of youngsters India will be banking on AI for its economic growth and improvement in the quality of life of its citizens. There are several startups that are based in cities such as Bengaluru New Delhi Mumbai and Hyderabad which work on artificial intelligence principles to serve consumers better. Their product range varies from multilingual chatbots to online shopping assistance and automated consumer data analysis ampx200B Processing img 5qz6wrviz6d31... ampx200B THE ROAD AHEAD The National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence which was put together by the government of India through NITI Aayog sets the roadmap on how to develop AI in the country. The report points out how AI will help the country grow what are the strengths and what are the challenges on the way. The government has identified a few areas where it thinks AI will play a crucial role as far as India is concerned Capital and qualified manpower are the two main pillars that are required for the establishment and growth of any sector. India is home to a large talent pool of Science Technology Engineering and Math graduates. Companies such as Google Intel and Microsoft have been offering short term training programs to computer program developers which help them upskill in the area of AI programming. On the other hand AICTE the government body which governs and regulates professional education in India recently added AI IoT Machine Learning and few other subjects as mandatory subjects in its curriculum of B.Tech programs. Changes in curriculum and content are further expected in the days to come. Investment towards AI from private players has been increasing in India 44 million in 2016 to 77 million in 2017. The startups have been working towards developing various AIbased products and services. With conglomerates having a lions share in Indias market there is huge scope for AIbased enterprise solutions in the country.

Cheap India Airfares DiscountFlights: [removed]. ISRO launch debate from a foreign perspective: Im an Indian from Malaysia and today I noticed that ISRO was trending. Naturally I was interested to see whats up and almost everyother post was about caste religion ethnic poverty etc. I understand that these issues poverty corruption etc should not be swept under the rug however bringing them up in a post celebrating probably Indias greatest achievement seems a little off putting. I understand nothing is perfect so there should be critique and I champion for Indians home and abroad to always bring the government to task and be the reliable check and balance society needs. What I can offer you is an outside looking in perspective. Based on the issues I see and know of about India as well stuff over in Malaysia and the other places Ive been or heard about. I hope this comes across as sharing and not like me preaching to the massess. 1. Indias strength is its people. The common man of India is amazing. The common man has achieved so much home and abroad. From the CEOs to the Filmstars. No politician is gonna make India great the people are. TBH India is rarely in the news for the right reasons. Everytine youre proud to be Indian because an Indian kid did something amazing the kid is usually some spelling bee champ in the US or the first ethnic minority cricket champ in the UK etc. Motherland India dominates the negative news. Its how the western media is. So whenever theres an opportunity to make India proud ot should be grabbed. The people have the power now. With social media media stranglehold and traditional stereotyping is dying. India is way over 1B strong. Try to bring that unity in promoting all the good in India. And not try to act smart by constantly belittling India in order to get the validation of the whiteman. Look at the United States. Trump is barely what the US and even the Republican party wants and needs. Every single presidential candidate that hated on Trump is now his biggest supporter. Because they know Trump is all they got for the survival of the Republican Party in the US. Get behind India. 2. Race and Religion. This is a touchy topic. And I do have opinions on some issues that Ive read about but Im not gonna bring em up here. All I can say is Oppose and Embrace. Embrace Indias diversity. Make it your strengths. The various languages that they are. If you dont like Hindi being put up as a main language then oppose it. Its fine. But dont oppose learning it. And if you do dont forget your own mother tongue. Learn more and grow more. The issue about the Isro scientist visiting a temple. How is this bad Let the man pray and do whatever he wants. It gets good press among the majority Hindu population and the majority Theist population in this country. Look to Hong Kong and China. Feng Shui elements are built into the city. The buildings have fengshui consultants. Heck Look at UAE. Arabs especially Muslims get so much stick in western countries. But white celebrities will readily parade around in the arab garbs because UAE has built a rep for itself. Everywhere in the world theres a group or region of people that feel they are unique and try to separate from the country they are in. India is no different. Try strength in diversity. Every other major country around India is moving forward. India still seems stuck with small issues. Think of the bigger picture to progress this nation whilst still championing for the small issues etc. 3. Dont derail ISRO. Everytime any news about ISRO comes on there is always the same comics about how India is not feeding the poor etc. This kinda dumb comics written by own guy for his daily paycheck is then circulated constantly and the ISRO space program is questioned. India can both have a thriving space program while feeding its poor and have a cleab environment. Support ISRO but champion these issues too. And not try to belittle the people who work on the various other fields in India. I guess thats it. All I can say as a minority Indian in another country its sad to see Indians in a country with majority Indians somehow constantly tumbling over the simplest of issues instead of growing. Youre playing right into the hands of those that dont want you to grow.. Any thoughts on this. Chandrayaan 2 Everything You Need To Know About ISROs New Moon Mission. Is Aadhar really facilitating financial inclusion: Though there has been a rise in financial inclusion in the recent years experts doubt whether it is a result of Aadhar. Other schemes such as the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana which has relaxed the minimum deposit limits and documentary requirements for opening bank accounts have been pointed to in this regard. Kshitija Joshi a professor at the Indian Institute of Sciences in Bengaluru argues that Aadhaarenabled financial inclusion is clearly not happening since poor people are being turned away from formal credit not due to the cost of verifying identities or personal details but because banks dont have the kind of loans they need such as personal loans. We should also look at the demand side of the problem the habits of rural populations in using financial products rather than simply trying to either look at the perspective of the companies or try to solve these issues using technology.

Congratulations on the successful Rocket Launch: Sitting here in Australia and watching your mighty country launch multiple tonnes of metal into space was quite humbling.

From the discovery of zero as a number to the darkside of the moon India has been a strong innovator in the sciences and deserves more recognition from the rest of us. Well done friends Cant wait to visit next year when I accompany my friend on his pilgrimage from India to Pakistan.. Is it just me or does anyone feel like NASA is being condescending in this tweet. These replies by Indians on NASAs congratulating tweet to ISRO is so cringeworthy: https//mobile.twitter.com/nasa/status/1153298524383141890 NASA literally tweeted that how our Chandrayaan2 will help them when they will step on moon again and Indians being Indians said they were flexing on us and asked them to use Burnol. Seriously Space exploration is about cooperation and the greater good of mankind and not about patriotism. If all we do is pissing contest then we will make no progress at all. Our ego will be our downfall. And then there is Missing Mangal movie which will add fuel to this fire by making the whole movie about Patriotism and nothing about Space exploration.

Custom Firmware on Jio GigaFiber Router: I left Jio Gigafiber and I have the FTTH router with me but it has modified firmware by Jio which blocks using services from any other ISP. Is it possible to install a custom firmware on this router as I have read online that there are custom firmware built for routers for many reasons and developing one for this will be helpful as its a good looking and sturdy router with decent range and there are many people like me who have not got their money back so I plan on using this router with another service provider. Why I left JioGigafiber I got the Jio GigaFiber after giving into the hype of Refundable Deposit amp Free High Speed Internet Services until the services are made public. After a week I started facing issues in the services mainly pertaining to Internet Speed which was not stable it used to fluctuate between 1565 Mbps with 23 days of very slow amp unstable internet almost every week which sounds decent for a free trial subscription but is not worth replacing main internet connection service. Anyway after complaining about it to the Jio Team and asking for the Refundable deposit back its been over 45 days which is the stipulated time to receive my money back I have not yet got a single penny and so I decided to use the FTTH router..

One needs to investigate the reason for low employment in core engineering sectors such as Mechanical Engineering Civil Engineering and so on before dismissing them as low employment potential and jumping on the AI bandwagon. The disciplines supposedly termed as low employment are essential to the development of the countries infrastructure. Bulk of the engineers working in many of the Government PSUs Government Engineering Research Laboratories such as DRDO and BARC Indian Engineering Services and even combat engineers in the army belong to these disciplines India has never even reached the pinnacle of research in these fields to just dismiss them as not worthy of being pursued. These basic engineering disciplines have always formed the cornerstone of what is considered the very mantle and basis of all engineering. Instead the AICTE should focus on revamping the curriculum to make it more interdisciplinary and relevant to current fields. In my opinion by intentionally creating a surplus of engineers trained in a particular field because of an ongoing trend is only going to be detrimental in the future. There is an urgent need to instill the importance of an interdisciplinary education and highlight the benefit of picking up transferable skills to make student across all forms of engineering more employable..

Scientific reasons have shown that it cures diseases like cancer HIVautism epilepsy acute and chronic pain muscular and neuroligical conditions mental disorders and hundreds of other conditions. 2Its a preventative medicine. A homeostatis state is where the body arrivesand remains in a balanced state which can be easily achieved through the medicinal compunds found in cannabis flowers 3We should have our right to medicine.

It is the duty and moral esponsibility of every doctor to use any means that are safe effective and affordable by all to heal their patients. 5 It is a natural stress reliever. Being in a stressful state disorients the mindbody mechanism which eventually leads to many diseases. cannabis helps create an effectively destressed state of mind. 6 Its time to eradicate toxic pharmaceuticals. Medicines which are synthetic and have terrible testing methods with low cure rates are sold to our people at extremely high costs. Cannabis has no harmful side effects needs no animal testing and can completely cure or help efficiently control hundreds of diseases. 7Hemp fibres are a multi billion dollar industry The plant produces maximum amount of cellulose and highest biomass per acre in comparison to any other plants. 8 Hemp has over 50000 applications. Our global consumption of crude oil coal cement petroleum plastics wood paper cotton etc. os destroying most of our natural resources. From furniture to plastics medicines to cosmetics highly nutrioussuperfoods to healing medicines fuels to bio batteries hemp if the most effective solution. 9Hemp products are ecofriendly 10 Its a great alternative to synthetic products. 11Hemp answers all the basic needs of man. 12 It can eradicate unemployment Agriculture research manufacturing processing small and large scale industries recycling transport packaging trade commercial businesses and many more. 13 Hemp industires reverse population densities in cities.

If introduced as a taxable crop every acre of arable land has the potential to boost economy. 17We have the right to protect the earth. The acti of protecting our home comes from growing and producing and consuming only ecofriendly products. Hemp is the most excelent ecofriendly alternative to all our needs but prohibited without any justification 18 Do not encourage yellow journalism When lawsare based on lies and propaganda it warrants the need to be removed as soon as possible especially when it effects the lives of billions of people. 19 It doesnt deserve a nonbailable offence. Adding cannabis under the ndps law has made life miserable for millions of people especially for those living in the himalayan regions where their only source of income is through hemp 20 It can help reduce organised drug trade. Prohibition of the plant has not worked and it has given birth to the organised drug trade. It is being adulterated or poisoned with harmful chemicals to produce a stronger experience. Organised drug tades help catalyse black money crime and many other illegal activites. 21Cannabis can make us happy.

Ayurveda documents outline the medical benefits of bhaang and our vydyas used bhaang as medicine to cure hundreds of ailmets for thousands of years vedas and ayurveda are scriptures and sacred knowledge of our motherland. 25Gaanja is a sacred herb. Our rishish who wrote the vedas were the scientists of our past who understand the norms of the cosmic world by connecting their consciousness to it. Our rishis considered it to be one of the most sacred plants griwing in the land of bhaaratha 26Bhaang is a spiritual tonic. Cannabinoids the compunds produced by the plant are very powerful in diluting the ego of the ones who consume it. Over long runs people have experienced a shift in personality towards life where they are much more connected to themselves and their surroundings 27Cannabis helps in deaddiction People who use cannabis regularly can recognise these patterns of addictions much easily and gain stronger willpower to overcome that problem.Cannabis helps you to defeat or destroy your bad habits. ampx200B ampx200B Please support our cause on r/GanjaMarch.

I hope this subreddit is the correct place for this post. ampx200B I want some career advice but I have no friends in the relevant fields to ask. I graduated in electrical engineering and learnt absolutely nothing and have no skills to get me a job in electrical field. So I turned to IT and worked there for 1 year and god it was shit. I decided I will never get into IT and get into some product based companies. The issue is I have no education in CS. I quit last year and decided to give GATE2019 in CS/IT paper to make my way into the computer science fields as I feel I am good at coding and stuff. I got AIR of 5300 in the GATE exam and am trying again for next year. Ill continue with masters in whichever college I get if I dont get a good score this year too. ampx200B So now Im completely clueless as for what my future plans are. Other than attempting GATE and doing masters. What am I supposed to do next I feel like I dont have any practical skills to make myself employable. I can write programs in C and solve intermediate level coding problems on Hackerrank or similar coding sites. But I doubt that is enough to get me a job. I am thinking of learning some online courses and learn something other than C. But what should I learn What do I have to learn to make myself employable I understand that what I should start learning depends on which job I want to get into. But I cant decide and have no one to consult. I hear some buzzwords like data science and machine learning on the news and online but I dont know if that is right for me. ampx200B I thought of getting into the following fields ML Data science Web development Android development. But again I have not the slightest idea of any of those. As far as I understand ML and Data science requires more math and I cant say Im good at math. With web development Im afraid it is not like traditional coding and wonder if it has good job opportunities here in India. If you know any other good field with good opportunities in India please suggest. ampx200B TLDR I know that I have a goal. Which is to get a good coding related job. But I dont know how to get to that goal. Nor which technology I should get into. So please help me decide.. Amazing moment for india laughing chandrayaan 2 having budget less than Hollywood movies.

My thoughts regarding pubg addiction: Guys pls read full comment and then comment if u think I am wrong and feel free to reply Who am I I am M 18 A pubg player who used to play pubg for like 4 hours a day from season 1 A few days after the game was launched . U may say I was addicted to pubg. Do I still play pubg Yes I still do play pubg. But not everyday. I play it very less than before. I only play if my friend msg me if we should play pubg at a particular time. If both of us are free at same time and willing to play then we play else no one plays or plays for like 10 mins How did I reduce my time spent on pubg 1. Glitch and bugs like 1 tap glitch and car glitch and lag in general made me feel that I should not play 2. My friends also felt the same. I used to play most games with my friends because I felt playing with random wasnt as much fun. So we all started to play less Why do people commit suicide Firstly we are notified of serious incidents like suicide / murder but pubg should have also destroyed many relationships/ friendships Personally I do not think that pubg alone can lead to such sad incidents. The person had no one to speak freely with. No one would listen. Maybe peer pressure made him frustrated. Maybe parents instead of helping taunted the child. Maybe the society made fun of the person. All the saturated anger/depression was the actual reason. Maybe the person thought that the way the escape everyday boring life was playing and playing pubg. Is playing online games to take our anger good Yes as well as no. You may feel good after you scream at usually random people but you may also feel more frustrated if they all are against you and u arent so good in game. In such cases it is a very bad choice Have I faced similar situation and what did I do Yes even I play online games to take out my anger and sometimes get even more angry. I just quit the game and start watching some anime I like sports anime works the best for me . Going out for playing or short walks or talking with friends or playing with pets should be better options but many times we cant do it. People should find what works best for them and do it and relax Are parents responsible for such incidents I cant directly say if someone is responsible. But parents should help the child. My suggestions to parents 1. Please dont bring the topic about how the current generation is addicted to phones and pubg and u were like x better. It irratates and makes all of us angry. Because ur generation has ruined every single thing. Most of us dont have land to play. Many are forced to compete for marks even when they arent ready. Ur generation invented phone. School/College and tuition leave very less time to just chill and enjoy. 2. Talk to children like a friend 3. If you notice significant change then pls ask someone for help.

Those B cells should then be gathered from the mouses spleen and moved to a bioreactor where they are regularly intertwined with another cell type similar to unfading tumor cells that enables them to recreate and get by outside the creature.

Automation In Our Society:  One word has become synonymous with the current economy and job market thats automation. Automation has been happening all around us for years but the pace of it has increased substantially in recent times. We are staring at highly automated work environments where the need for people has become inefficient automation has crept up slowly across industries and has become a major threat to future economies of countries. The problem is that there hasnt been a concrete solution no one seems to be agreeing on what could be the solution to this. Automation in manufacturing industry has been constantly increasing the coveted assembly line model by Henry Ford that streamlined the manufacturing process by making it efficient has in these modern times been a reason for automation to take over jobs. A decade or two ago you could see people working in assembly line but now if you go to any manufacturing plant there is a high chance that youll be seeing people only doing quality inspection on the assembly lines instead of doing any assembly thats because all of it is being done by Robots that have gotten so efficient and cost effective in the long run that there is no reason to have people assembling it. Look at the IT sector for an example a decade ago when you dialled a customer support of a company there would be people picking up your phone and addressing you concern or complaints but now when you call customer support of a company its a jumbled mess of pre recorded options that you press if you are lucky and have pressed the right options for a couple of times you might get lucky and actually have a person who might address your problem. Now think about both of these examples the expertise required for assembling has been replaced by inspection of assembled stuff which requires much less technical knowledge and experience. Same goes for the IT sector now a couple of hundred of people can handle a countrys customer support because of pre recorded options. This has obviously helped in increasing productivity in both industries and has made it easier and efficient process. There have been people who have dismissed the buzz words of AI Artificial Intelligence and ML Machine Learning but software tools powered by AI and ML have been able to make a dent in management industry as well. For some time automation has only affected the workers or the labour intensive tasks but AI powered software has made many management position redundant. In the service industry you can already see bigger retailers either going online or having less and less number of people employed in their stores with the high penetration of internet now payments have become increasingly cashless and you can see stores with self checkout counters in the west. You shouldnt be surprised if in the future you enter a mall early morning to get your groceries and you end up being the only person in the whole mall since every task now has been automated. The major industry that is yet to be affected by this onslaught of automation has been driving the goods carriers the taxi drivers and truck drivers the delivery guy who delivers your Amazon orders or the Swiggy guy who delivers you your food. There is a big chance that over the decade you might see all of them disappear with self driving cars and trucks drone delivery for goods becoming a reality the industry will move quickly and make all of these automated. Atleast now you can take that extra nap you need in your self driving car when you head out to work or eat your breakfast in it. Imagining all of this must give people a sense of comfort on how the future will be becoming more convenient but the fact is that it would come at cost of hundreds of thousands of jobs. While it is true that newer jobs will be created there is no doubt that it will never be as many as automation will be replacing. There have been solutions to these suggested such as robot tax which is taxing a company more for more automation or solutions such as Universal Basic Income which addresses the post automation world where jobs are less and people need to be subsidised for living. While not working does seem like an absurd option maybe it actually isnt hobbies can become lifestyle choices more people can go into sports with the space exploration in the horizon maybe we can go back to exploration while this will obviously guarantee that capitalism will make the balance of society uneven where we will have the ultra rich that will have majority of the wealth distributed among a single percent of the population it will be the job of the future governments economists and leaders to address these problems.

Hydroponics and Agtech Entrepreneurship in India Dhrav Khanna Triton Foodworks: For the last 10 years I have spent the majority of my time looking at sustainability as a function of urbanization and the resource footprints of urban residents in Asia. Particularly how will Asia urban systems be challenges by the movement of the next two billion Asians moving into cities by 2030 and what the role of entrepreneurs and innovators will be as THE force to deliver the solutions required for sustainability in local environments economies and communities. So while the news surrounding Chennais water shortage are now top of mind and in keeping in mind there are dozens of other cities in India that are under similar threat earlier this year I met with an amazing entrepreneur named Dhrav Khanna of Delhi based Triton Foodworks and interviewed him about his work. It was an amazing discussion similar to those I have had in Bangkok Singapore and Hong Kong and while I was impressed by his systems and saw similar challenges in business model the one thing I really appreciated was in his approach to measuring how much water his systems saved again traditional farming. The interview is around 20 minutes so it is not short but if you are an Indian looking for examples of individuals who are solving local problems using local innovation this is a great interview and I hope you will share this with your networks. ampx200B Link to interview here [Hydroponics and Agtech Entrepreneurship in India Dhrav Khanna Triton Foodworks]https//www.youtube.com/watchv1g8jZulcINs..

Headphonezone.in deleted my review citing negatives about the RHA Trueconnect True Wireless Earbuds: [Link to the product page]https//www.headphonezone.in/collections/truewirelessearbuds/products/rhatrueconnect Cost INR 15000 Issue Headphonezone claims that it has tieups with the British sound company RHA. And thus its logical that they stand to lose something if the Trueconnects are negatively reviewed on the HPZ site thus impacting sales. I have been researching headphones for a while and I dont want to settle for lowquality sound after being used to Sennheisers. The HPZ site users rate the Trueconnects are 4.8/5 stars 18 reviews. Theres also an our pick sticker on the product thus giving it their specialists approval. Now 15 thousand rupees is a big amount to pay and it better be worth it. And since I knew that HPZ might be partial to this product I decided to check other respected reviewers. Flossy Carter calls it [170 worth of trash]https//www.youtube.com/watchvpxudUEFdu34. Jims Review Room praises the design and build but gives it [a really low score for sound quality]https//www.youtube.com/watchvK0QPCHStQ7o. Now whats the point of all the pricing and design if it doesnt deliver its most important requirementgood sound So my purpose of posting the review citing these reviewers on the [Headphonezone.in]https//Headphonezone.in site was to give the other side of the story about the product since I only saw positive reviews on the site and users might be unaware while splurging on these earphones trusting HPZ. And they deleted my review. So I wonder if all the positive reviews are either paid or typed in a herdmentality manner. It also goes to show that among any genuine reasons they may have had for deleting my review they cant take in criticism for a product they are partnering with in India thus placing manufacturer above their customers.. 11 smartphones under Rs 35000 that sport the best camera.

Choosing between Canada or Western Europe for higher studies: Hey Everyone I am a 21 years old Ill graduate in 2020 with a degree in Electrical and Electronics. I am planning to move to either of the following countries Netherlands Germany or Canada by August 2020. I needed some advice from Indian expats/students living in one of these countries. Im aiming for a masters in aerospace/automobile or management of technology TU Delft/ TU Munich/ McGill with aim of settling down/staying hence this sub. Which country should I finalize I can speak English and Hindi and Im willing to learn Dutch. I have cleared A levels in German but from all my research Ive concluded that Western Europe will only be willing to let me into their universities but they wont offer me jobs wont take me in wont let me integrate into their countries as easily as Canada would. Apparently the job market also seems to be biased against non EU skilled STEM students as well. It was my dream to live and settle in Europe but the reality seems to be that Europe doesnt want many Indians there and jobs are only given if there isnt any EU member available for that role considering all of these aspects should I aim for Canada or Netherlands/Germany.

How allotment of a used number while taking a new mobile connection has costed me money.:  Im writing this to express my frustration and concern for the aspirational dream of a Digital India. Im a fairly educated Indian with a good hold of technology. I use Internet more than an average Indian. Im sharing all this because it is important to let you all know that if this can happen to a person like me how tough it would be for a nontechnical person. I will share three different incidents and how together they all have made my life tougher. Incident 1 I have a 4year old Airtel postpaid account. This number was allotted to me probably after staying inactive for days/months. Incident 2 I receive multiple bank alerts on my number probably of the person who used this number before. I reach out to Airtel sometime in 2017 to get the alerts stopped. Airtel asks me to get in touch with the bank. I reach out to the bank SBI yes State Bank of India. Since Im not a customer their is no defined mechanism to get in touch with them. I somehow reach out to them through social media then their website and then email. After multiple threads trying to explain my situation Im asked to go to the home branch just calling it out again Im not their customer and get the number removed from there. After multiple tries I give up and accept my fate of getting the alerts. Incident 3 Sometime in 2018 Paytm launches their own UPI platform and I sign up for it. While signing up for it I am asked for selecting a bank and unknowingly I click State Bank of India probably the only mistake. The app hangs and I close the app. Period. Fast forward to June 2019 my friend sends me money through Paytm UPI platform and I get a notification that Ive received the money. I open the app check my Paytm wallet and theres no money. Although I see that my Paytm UPI platform has a bank account linked and the money has gone there. It is an SBI account which Ive no idea and I can only see the last four digits of the account number. I try to check balance/withdraw my money but I can not. I cant use the money because I dont have the debit card details obviously because it is not my account and hence I havent setup the PIN. Multiple calls to Paytm I force the representative to escalate the call and finally Im told that I had linked this SBI account and I need to get in touch with both the banks SBI and another one from which the money was sent to get the transaction reversed. In a nutshell money gone for a toss. I am obviously going to now remove the account from Paytm UPI but I want a permanent fix to this problem. If anyone who happens to know how to get rid of this please help me out. I will be very grateful and in fact if youre in NCR I will treat you as well. TLDR Airtel allotted me a used number which is still being used by someone for their SBI bank account and money sent to my Paytm UPI is going in this account and I dont know how to get rid of this.

National Education Policy 2019 highlights automatic summarization: Theres been a lot of noise lately around the latest National education policy draft published by the central government of IndiaMHRD. The draft was designed by a team of esteemed people which includes the likes of Dr. Kasturi Rangan head of the committee Former ISRO chief amp Manjul Bargav fields medal awardee. Amidst all the unnecessary controversy the NEP 2019 is a significant draft towards the strengthening of our broken education system. If implemented effectively this is bound to change the quality of education in India in a very significant way. In short to paraphrase Dr. Kasturi Rangan the policy is radical and designed to change generations to come with proper implementation. The original document is about 478 pages long. Its rather a huge document which you can find here [https//mhrd.gov.in/sites/upload\files/mhrd/files/Draft\NEP\2019\EN\Revised.pdf]https//mhrd.gov.in/sites/uploadfiles/mhrd/files/DraftNEP2019ENRevised.pdf ampx200B Essentially its a huge tome you might not be compelled to read it given its rather a large lengthy document amp hence I decided to summarize the whole document into a much shorter version using an NLP algorithm that Ive been working on. The smaller version is about 53 pages longwe call this as the NEP 2019 highlights book . If interested enjoy reading the summarized version of this significant policy change that is brought up. there could be some readability issues here and there considering natural language summarization is a very tough challenge. If you have any suggestions as to how to fix it or you have any ideas please contact me maybe we can collaborate. ampx200B you can find the NEP 2019 highlights book over here [https//file.io/5UgHJY]https//file.io/5UgHJY.

How do you think this will impact your area of work . Is Anyone Else Experiencing Sudden Slow Internet in India How do you Fix it: I have a high speed broadband connection. Its been working fine for 3 years now. My average download speed for everything is about 1.5 Mbps. ampx200B A couple of months back my internet service provider said that they were doing some upgrading work on their connections and the internet will be off for a day. ampx200B Ever since that day my internet has been acting bizarre. Im experiencing very slow download rates on every site except for Youtube and Steam. Whenever I download anything from Youtube or Steam the speed ranges from 4 MBPS to 10 Mbps. Thats even higher than before. However the speeds on every other site have been very low 60 Kbps. ampx200B Online gaming performance has also suffered. I experience a lot of lag and high ping whereas that was not the case before the upgrade. It was smooth. ampx200B Why has this happened It it seems like the internet is jumping through more hoops now to reach servers and thats why its experiencing such poor connectivity. Whereas earlier it could easily connect to all servers. I think the reason why Youtube and Steam have such good download rates is because they have efficient servers all over the world so its not that difficult to connect to their servers. ampx200B When I told my ISP about the problem they just come over and do a speed test and a Youtube download test and say everythings fine. They say they cannot help beyond that. ampx200B Is there a way to fix this Going into internet settings and finding out whats wrong Is there a tutorial online that can help.

What if Depression / Anxiety could be alleviated by focused conversation Implementing Bohm Dialogue using Reddit: Hey guys A few weeks back I had a disagreement with a friend over politics. NBD However he was surprised that he was actually having a civil discussion on the matter and so we have developed trust over such discussion. More importantly he introduced me to Bohm Dialogue. https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BohmDialogue gt Bohm Dialogue is a freely flowing group conversation in which participants attempt to reach a common understanding experiencing everyones point of view fully equally and nonjudgementally. This can lead to new and deeper understanding. Since I have been working on digital interventions for mental distress I eventually ended up incorporating the system in a subreddit. It is located here at /r/songofthephoenix. So far the experiment seems to be working. People do feel a sense of release and calm in the conversations even if it is only temporary. If this works out properly we can have a scalable intervention that assists patients in between their medical appointments. If any one of you is interested in the experiment are experiencing distress or know someone who is experiencing distress I invite you check out the subreddit. Moreover I have seen the many posts that people have here that relate to Abusive Relationships Career fuckups Depression and cluelessness after bad exams / graduation. These are recurrent problems and have their own patterns. I will try and respond to the threads here itself. Regarding Abusive Relationships I would like to talk about one concept Narcissistic abuse. Just by discussing one topic over here in /r/India we can positively influence many many lives. Many people are stuck in the relationships that they are because of abusive partners who prey on their fears. Was also discussed in Daniel Sloss Netflix special Jigsaw. Thats it Hopefully we can solve the current mental health crisis at scale within the next couple of years and turn it into a more manageable situation. Really looking forward to hear from you guys.

Abortion law in india: If youve been to r/all youll notice that certain states in the US have almost completely banned medical abortions so i thought Id give an overview of the indian scenario In India medical abortion is legal upto 20 weeks of gestation First what is a medical abortion. A woman can undergo abortion spontaneously . that is called spontaneous abortion or a miscarriage.. that happens due to a wide range of issues like chromosomal anomalies uterine anomalies.. etc Now if we give some drugs and do some procedures and cause abortion its an induced abortion Induced abortion in a controlled prescribed environment constitutes a medical abortion So in india its legal to get abortion upto 20 weeks in the following scenarios 1. When there is a serious threat to life of mother due to continuation of pregnancy 2 . Following rape or incest this is outlawed in alabama.. a us state and northern ireland 3. When child has lethal congenital anomaly like head missing.. 4. Social.. like failure of contraceptive.. this blanket reason can cover any abortion.. you can go and say my condom failed and can get an abortion.. no checks.. So laws wise we are pretty good.. problem is with access cause most rural women cant get any contraception whatsoever. Some women attempt local techniques like calotropis stem insertion which aborts the pregnancy but can lead to sepsis Unmet need for contraception is around 23.. these ppl have no clue that there are birth spacing techniques available that can delay and appropriately space births...

Need A Some Information About Old Computers: Hey guys I am in the process of building a computer for video editing. There are just two criteria that I need to fulfil 1. A computer capable of editing 4K video with moderately respectable speeds. 2. Spend as little money as possible. Buying all the parts separately even second hand seem to drive up the cost. So probably is not a great idea. I scoured many internet forums and facebook groups and found that most of the really cheap budget builds are actually done on really old systems which are bought second hand. I also found that in the US most governmentrun institutions like hospitals and universities decommission all their computers after 5years and sell them off. Doesnt matter if they are working or not they are not used anymore. Is there anything like that here in India where I can score some cheap parts or a full system TLDR Does anyone know a way to buy secondhand computers which big companies or govt selloff after a specific period of time If yes how do I go about trying to buy one Any information about this is highly appreciated.

One Plus Bullet Wireless my thoughts: Just giving my few cents on the One Plus bullets wireless. To clear few things these are my first wireless headphones. Now after using them for a week. The Range is okay not great not too awesome. One Plus 6 shows me the battery status the 6T would too but not sure about other devices. Pairing with other devices is super easy. No NFC Battery life is 56 hours never more than this. the audio is sync with video or plain and simple No Lags Charging is indeed fast 3040 minutes for a full charge Call Quality is good microphone is good I sweat a lot and so far the type C port seems to be holding up fine Audio Quality is frankly a bit overhyped. Wired Sennheiser ear phones that cost less than 2k will beat these on any day again I dont know how other offering are at this range but people saying you got more than what you paid for seems like a crap claim. I have used the Samsung LevelU on a few occasions and the Audio Quality if youre using any device apart from One Plus or devices with aptX then the audio is not really that different bullets wireless sounds better but again not like mindblowingly better. Samsung LevelU has the hey seems like youre far away from the phone complaint but so far people have not given me that complaint during my calls with bullet wireless. A few ear tips/buds provided spend time seeing which one is best. The default one gave a weird sound when the fan was running at full speedI know weird. Audio Quality changed quit a lot with ear bud change. Some lag in PUBG not a huge dealy but still you can tell the difference with wired and these. The reason I am writing this review is because many people want to buy wireless but I think you should really consider what your priorities are... If Music Quality Gaming experience matter than sticking to good old wired is the best decision. or may be go for something like the Sennheiser BT 4.40 which costs more but also has AUX Cable option that might come in handy when your gaming and every micro second counts P ampx200B I know phone manufacturers are going all fuck headed about this but the choice of good wireless earphones is really slim. A few cities have experience stores always give the Sony/Sennheiser/Samsung etc wireless ear phone you are going to buy a trial. Buying purely based on reviews may not be such a good decision. No point spending 4k or 5k and ending up with a product that is not meeting your expectations.

This friend after she had broken up with her boyfriend a couple of weeks back started receiving threatening calls from unknown numbers telling her to stop calling the people she had been calling. At first she did not understand what was going on but as the calls started becoming more and more violent demanding why shed called a particular person and so on she became very concerned and afraid. At this point there was little doubt in her mind who the person was behind all of this. After some digging we found out that the said boyfriend had added her Jio number to his account in the MyJio app. He had obviously obtained the OTP that you require to add the number when he had access to her phone back when they were friends. We tried all we could to contact many Jio customer care centers to try and find a way to remove her number from this guys Jio account but so far nobody has claimed that there is a way to do that. It is very important that people know that in a circumstance like this when another person has your number added to his/her Jio account that person can get access to your personal info including the people youve called the time and duration of calls the people youve sent messages to your internet data balance etc. the worst and the most concerning part is that you cannot and do not have a way to know any of this from your MyJio app which just means that you would not know it if someone has your number tied in with his/her Jio account and there is no way for you to remove your number from that persons phone or stop that person from accessing your information unless you port your number or deactivate it. If what I think I know is correct then this is a really dick move by Jio giving the user so little control over how his/her account is used considering the fact that the MyJio app requires you to give so many permissions for it to run. In my opinion this is a very serious security flaw that Jio must address or come up with something to counter my points or prove me wrong. As for my friend her family is now utterly traumatized and they have been threatened to not notify the police. They are really simple people and are very much unwilling to go to the authorities about this bastard who has been terrorizing her.. India successfully shoots down satellite in space PM Modi.

DO NOT buy these ROUTERS if you have a fiber connection: I was browsing through amazon and the so called best selling AC dual band routers are the most ridiculous products ever. Most of the routers below Rs.2000 have 100Mbit LAN ports and if you have a fiber connection thats over 100Mbit/sec it wont be sufficient and you simply have to buy a new router with gigabit ports. When the main internet connection is capped at 100Mbit/sec by such routers there is no way your true potential of the wireless upgrade will feel useful. Simply put what is the use if your wired connection ports are slower than the wireless connection in your router. Lets say you have an expensive network attached storageNAS. And you have connected your 4k OLED smart TV to your new AC750 router. You start streaming from your NAS and alas it lags like it used to before. Its because your LAN ports are capped at 100Mbit/sec. Meanwhile if the NAS is connected to the router wirelessly you will get improved speeds. Unless you are using WAN and LAN ports at the same timewirelessly the extra benefit of the wireless wont even reflect in your day to day usage. I am surprised this hasnt been widely called out. Everyone talks about how these companies advertise theoretical speeds where they add up Wireless N Wireless AC and advertise the sum number but i consider the lack of Gigabit ports as even more stupider. Gigabit is the standard today. Bad products such as these are made to exploit naive consumers and stay away from it.. Wheat Pill Poisoning in Subcontinent and its effects..

Jio is using sophisticated technologies to arbitrarily block websites: Its no secret that Jio loves filtering content more than other operators reason as misty as a hazy window.

There is a reason for it. And it didnt take that long for them to block [pornhub.net]https//pornhub.net or [xvideos.net]https//xvideos.net . The thing is unlike the DNS level block implemented by other operators Jio is using deep packet introspection which is very surprising to be used for a telecom operator. Funny part is when the server overloads the DPI fails and reddit and pornhub magically starts to work. I still dont understand why Jio has this beef with reddit as Vodafone itself has unblocked it. . Many of you might have known that Jio has banned Reddit.com: I am still able to access it via the app. ampx200B I called the customer care of Jio Gigafiber about it and the guy told me that the govt has banned the website.

My friends village gets electricity after 71 years of Independence. He shared his happiness with me [Story below]: One of my office colleagues is from a remote location which he never felt comfortable mentioning. Today while I was passing by he called me and asked me to have a Kit Kat as he was celebrating. ampx200B I asked the reason and he said his village finally got an electricity connection. I thought he was kidding and to my surprise he was not. I was taken back for a moment with this thought. ampx200B While our country is busy investing heavily in defense in space exploration and various initiatives we forget that there are regions in India which lack basic living necessities.

Are we really developing or living under an illusion of being a super power by next few decades ampx200B I live that up to you while I enjoy the Kit Kat with my friend and we celebrate for the new connection. ampx200B I hope he gets Paytm/Freecharge/Google Pay/Phone Pe discounts for his first electricity bill payment.

Interesting facts about MainBhiChowkidar campaign: PM Narendra Modi today launched the MainBhiChowkidar campaign on Twitter with a [tweet]https//twitter.com/narendramodi/status/1106759555315314689. It quickly went viral gaining over 80K likes in few hours and the Twitter trending page suggests that around half a million tweets have been posted so far containing the MainBhiChowkidar hashtag. ampx200B If you publish a tweet containing the MainBhiChowkidar hashtag you are very likely to receive a personalized reply from the official narendramodi handle thanking you for supporting the Main Bhi Chowkidaar movement. ampx200B It is obvious that Mr. Modi is not manually writing these thank you tweets but the job is handled by a Twitter bot. This bot is doing some smart things under the hood. Heres why 1. The tweets are worded differently. 2. The images of Mr. Modi embedded in the tweets are different per response. 3. The images contain a personalized message it includes the first name of the person who wrote the tweet. Writing a Twitter bot is easy but the MainBhiChowkidar bot is more than just a normal autoreply bot. It reads the tweets with the hashtag fetches the first name of the tweeter generates a dynamic JPEG image with that name and then sends a personalized reply with that image. The other interesting thing is that these autoreply tweets cannot be found through Twitter search. For instance a search for fromnarendramodi MainBhiChowkidar shows exactly 1 tweet and none of the response tweets. Also if you go to the replies timeline of narendramodi these reply tweets arent listed there though they have originated from that very account. .

AN EFFICIENT LINE CLIPPING ALGORITHM FOR CIRCULAR WINDOWS USING VECTOR CALCULUS AND PARALLELIZATION:  With the advent of digitization and growing abundance of graphic and image processing tools use cases for clipping using circular windows have grown considerably. This paper presents an efficient clipping algorithm for line segments using geometrical features of circle and vector calculus. Building upon the research with rectangular windows this method is proposed with the belief that computations are more expensive heavy than other computations. Execution time can be drastically improved if we replace expensive computations with cheaper computations. The cheaper computations can be computed even more efficiently using parallelization thus improving time complexity.. Best Icon Packs for Android.

ITRules SaveOurPrivacy RightToMeme:  https//i.redd.it/v82mt026awf21.png Highlights Background In December a private meeting was held by Ministry Officials with social media companies and industry associations. In this disturbing changes to the the Intermediary Rules were suggested. They would hurt our online privacy and be a massive blow to free speech online. Roll back this consultation We made it a point to explain to you the damaging effect it would have on your online freedom but we are not alone. Many other digital rights organisations have articulated a principled and powerful opposition to these proposed changes. You can help Send an email right now. We tell you how at the end of this post. Why are any changes to the Intermediary Rules important Intermediary rules impact all of us. Think about the legal rules that govern your ISP think Airtel IdeaVodafone Jio or others or a large social media platforms Wikipedia Github Facebook Sharechat Youtube Instagram Twitter etc. even small startup online services you use and enjoy for me it is personally IndianKanoon. Any changes to these rules not only massively change your online experience but also threaten your online privacy and free speech. In this context the proposed changes to them gain importance. What changes have been proposed In changes proposed late last year [read more here for context]https//internetfreedom.in/indiamustresistthelureofthechinesemodelofsurveillanceandcensorshipintermediaryrulesrighttomemesaveourprivacy/ the Ministry of Electronics and IT MEITY proposed changes to the Intermediary Rules 2011. This was initially done privately and after an Indian Express report and us publicly disclosing them in full MEITY acknowledged them and opened a public consultation. But there are problems with these proposed changes much beyond the initial secrecy. And its just not us saying this. Many other groups are taking leadership on this issue. There seems to be somewhat of a unanimous response of several civil society organisations and research groups for the government to reconsider these proposed changes. Even though many have articulated different reasoning emphasised a range of problems constitutional policyoriented economic and technical. They all seem to be in broad agreement that these rules are bad for users internet companies and the internet. They would hurt your privacy and online free speech without making you safer in any meaningful way. Even we in our submissions to an ongoing public consultation have made a clear call to MEITY to reboot this entire exercise [read here for more]https//internetfreedom.in/weurgemeitytopressrebootontheintermediaryrulessaveourprivacyrighttomeme/. But dont only take our work for it. We have tabulated a table [PDF]https//drive.google.com/file/d/1peFYrzfHwa5QoFMUFFtesdmMTdqEuDLi/viewuspsharing or [Google Docs]https//drive.google.com/openid1peFYrzfHwa5QoFMUFFtesdmMTdqEuDLi with the voice of digital rights and research organisations who in 16 separate submissions make a common point. The proposed changes to Intermediary Rules must be reconsidered if not recalled. What can you do to help Simple send an email to MEITY. This will not take more than a few minutes. Step 1 Create a covering email with the subject Proposed Changes to IT Rules which reads for instance as gtI support attached spreadsheet which quotes digital rights and research groups in their submissions against the unconstitutional provisions of The Information Technology Rules 2018 that will affect my Right to Privacy and Freedom of Speech online. I call on you to recall the proposed changes to the Intermediary Rules 2011 Step 2 Attach the sheet of comments [PDF]https//drive.google.com/file/d/1peFYrzfHwa5QoFMUFFtesdmMTdqEuDLi/viewuspsharing or [Google Docs]https//drive.google.com/openid1peFYrzfHwa5QoFMUFFtesdmMTdqEuDLi by digital rights and research organisations. Step 3 This email should be sent to gccyberlawmeity.gov.in pkumarmeity.gov.in sathya.smeity.gov.in. In the initial public comments only close to a 100 comments were sent to MIETY. Surely we can do better. The last date for submission is February 14 2019. This valentines day we have a moment to show how much we love the free and open internet.

TRAIs New Guidelines For Cable amp DTH Now Suggest Network Capacity Fee Not Mandatory For Multiple Connections. Gaming social media selfies This clinic in Bengaluru helps tech addicts log out. Selection of Optical fibre broadband connection: My parents live in Bhopal and are looking for alternatives to a BSNL broadband connection that they have had an EXTREMELY sour experience with due to overbilling very weak customer service and redressal despite being with the company as users from 1990. They have asked me for advice basically outsourced the recce required for the decision making. I am just about to begin my researching but have been a staunch believer of 1 se bhale 2 aur 2 se bhale 4 2 are better than 1 4 are better than 2 so that this research becomes more of a discussion and thus become more rounded and reliable for the benefit of my parents as well as any others who might happen to read this post. User requirementS in priority order 1. CUSTOMER SERVICE Should be hasslefree prompt and convenient. They have literally been made to run to the BSNL offices over a period of the past 6 months to get back their dues because the online customer care and pgportal turned out be ineffective. At their age they dont want to be dealing with this BS and would rather pay Rs.100 more per month for the convenience. 2. SPEED They arent satisfied with their mobile internet speeds which tend to be near the 7 Mbps mark when tested on [fast.com]https//fast.com. So gt40Mbps but use your judgement. Im unsure if lastmile connectivity is still an issue thereby hampering actual speeds which as a result tend to be much lower than the promised ones. Pl. educate me in this regard. 3. DATA QUOTA They already have unlimited mobile plans 2\1.4GB/day and thus curently only require a broadband for work ocassional Skype and basic surfing purposes. However they are SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING dropping their Digital cable connection and depend on OTT services as well online streaming such as Voot for Khatron Ke Khladi etc for their entertainment needs which last for only about four hours in the night since both are working. 100 GB with rollover should more than suffice but Ill let you be the best judges of this. 4. OTT BUNDLES Free subscriptions for Netflix Prime Hotstar etc. After a very brief skim from the only 3 options I know of Airtel vfiber Gio fiber and ACT I zeroed in on the Rs 699/799 Vfiber plan with 40Mbps 100GB/250GB with rollover but Im open to all suggestions including considerations I might have missed as well as Crossposting subs.

Amazon app is not as secure as it seems to be.: I recently logged in to the amazon app using my friends phone but something came up and in a hurry I forgot to log out of it. I told him over phone to log out of the app when I got home. He said he would but I am not sure if he did. Which is why I changed the password on my laptop through chrome browser. I wanted to double check so when I saw my amazon app in my phone the app was still logged in. So it seems like if you change passwords you cannot log out of the app automatically. It just prompts you to put passwords again only if you log back out. But it threw me out on my PC where it was supposed to be kept signed in through Firefox app. I am not sure what a person is supposed to do if their phone gets stolen How in the holy world is this app supposed to protect our privacy Fortunately there are no linked cards or anything on my account.

Sort of a solution for Indian Cable TV problem:  We were having issues with our cable most of the channels sometimes were unavailable except colors. I never bothered to get into Television cable things but it was really annoying paying 250 rs per month for that so I contacted the cable guy. To my surprise the FTA channels where around 130 rs tax I was like wait arent these the same channels which you can literally get for free by installing cheap DTH on your home / You might say well there are convenience and maintenance charges you cant just give 30 rs to keep the connection at your place for 3 chosen channels. Considering the channels I thought we should keep it was really costly so I bought an android box for my tv and its the best purchase I ever made for my family. Every mainstream channel has an app created by their broadcasters like voot hotstar sony liv and they put all episodes a day after the live telecast. Now you may say the Internet is not cheap here and its not as reliable as cable tv / So my friend just so you know I also belong to a small city where most affordable internet plans cost around 1000rs for just 23 mbps per month which is the reason why I use my old 3G dongle connected to my android tv box which gives around 10mbps. There are few lags here and there but its really great considering how my family now watches fewer tv channels shows more YouTube videos and other online quality content. I am really happy to see them using the internet as they dont understand English much Mom watches a few cooking shows etc and dad watch online news from subscribed channels which are anytime better than tv. Yes foul languages content is blocked and they check for age rating on prime video and Netflix. There are certain things you may want to watch live like sports matches finale shows for which I dont have any legal solution you can find some workaround online or request providers to let you pay just for 1 channel online and I am sure they will come up with something if more people prefer to use IPTV over traditional now overprice cable tv. I really wish the HD upgrade we had a few years ago would be less about settop box and more about coaxial cable which provides tv channels and internetthey could just enable/disable internet depending on the users P.S I am looking for online family friendly content need suggestions please. Thanks to the guy who suggested yeh meri family few days ago . PSA Redbus now supports Apple Maps. Management strategies of Hypertension without Medications.. A Republic Day letter from IFF: ampx200B https//i.redd.it/p575s4xxxpc21.png Greetings from a cold sunlit Delhi. Today most of the roads around India Gate are blocked as we welcomed a row of tableaus for the Republic Day parade. It gives all Indians a chance to take pride in the progress we have made. This includes our growing leadership in information technology. But even as we celebrate concerns linger on an uncertain future. At present large swathes of online commentary are pessimistic in an ongoing wave of a tech lash. This comes with good reason with growing threats to our liberties and rights from large platforms and government. In 2019 IFF views its mission seriously but with a sense of optimism. Over the past month we have taken actions and made considerable progress to ensure our constitutional promises with technology of liberty justice fraternity and equality are realised. This is possible with the continuing generosity and affection we have received from a growing community of supporters. More donors and volunteers are joining us I am pleased to first note that more individuals continue to donate to us. Going from 6 donors in October 2018 we scaled to 45 individual donations in December 2018. This month we have touched 36 donors. Such grassroots support helps us grow in strength and capacity as we accelerate our work. It brings me great joy as I have noticed many people are donating every month. To ease friction we will soon be rolling out an informal membership option where you can support our work with the option for a recurring contribution. While the total pool still does not match our needs each donation is a source of pride. We need more donors and more help and I am confident we will be able to meet our financial goals to hire staff and build capacity to fight off threats. As many of you have signed up to volunteer we would like to update you on our continuing efforts to enable internet users to defend digital rights. We are building civic capacity by efforts to form a community who share a passion for digital rights. To open up our work for engagement and review we are experimenting with a Slack group where we help curate conversations and discuss projects. Volunteers from the fields of technology policy and parliamentary experts litigators and academics are working in different workgroups and executing projects to a high degree of skill and expertise. Our engagement on social media and the community on Reddit has been an ongoing conversation of support and learning. Every day more people offer IFF help. They send a kind note make a donation offer their time even demand we do better \[correct our typos D\]. We have been busy Over the [past month]https//internetfreedom.in/ we have taken a range of actions on the core domains that are part of IFFs mandate. Privacy On January 14 [IFF]http//internetfreedom.in/ went to the Supreme Court challenging the digital surveillance powers that enabled the MHA Notification authorising 10 agencies to collect your personal data. We argued the system right now lacks any checks and balances. This is worrying as the government can collect and requisition our data arbitrarily. An important part of our petition is the SaveOurPrivacy campaign. In our case we have cited the fact that more than 11000 people and 32 organisations support surveillance reform in India. The Supreme Court has agreed to hear our case and issued notice to the Government. Earlier in the month we revealed the full text of the proposed changes to the Intermediary Rules and put out an analysis on how it was taking us towards a china model of digital command and control. Throughout the winter session of parliament we organised briefings for MPs and their offices on legislation that impact your privacy rights. Free Expression As threats grow to online censorship through censorship codes the revival of Section 66A yes we discovered it was still being used despite being ruled as unconstitutional and internet shutdowns we fought back. Our work over the past month includes a court intervention by the Peoples Union for Civil Liberties PUCL which relies on an IFF study parliamentary briefings and notices to various bodies particularly on online video streaming services. Surely no one will want to watch a censored final season of the Game of Thrones Net Neutrality and Innovation To ensure that the existing net neutrality laws do not become a dead letter we have started examining options at enforcement and remedy. The first step in this is data collection. IFF has launched an online form to gather reports of blocking of VPNs and proxy websites. In addition to this our policy work continues. We are actively corresponding with government bodies and participating in TRAI consultations. For instance in the latest OTT consultation we have asked TRAI not to license internet services and applications. Yes we are not giving up on saving the internet Our work is towards action that causes positive impact and public victories. All of it is captured in simple concise explainers on the [IFF website]https//internetfreedom.in/. Support our mission in 2019 Want us to scale up our efforts Become more effective in our work Ensure victories for your digital rights Then consider [donating to IFF]https//internetfreedom.in/donate/ No amount is small and we cherish every rupee of support that is extended to us. This republic day let us reflect on our constitutional promises. For liberty fraternity equality and justice.

You all should be aware of the history of Jio and the alternatives to it.: Most of the people dont realize that Jio has the habit of blocking websites since its inception. I remember during the free Jio days they blocked porn and torrent stating government order which never existed that time. However they unblocked once they started charging for services. Once their network started choking on load they started throttling some parts of traffic not entirely a practice incorporated by some telecom operators like Etisalat in UAE. However this is grossly in violation of net neutrality but since it was done mostly during peak hours not many users noticed it. Now this shit has started and the problem is that they wont even listen. Fortunately other operators still exist and you must give them a try. Here is my experience with other operators 1. Vodafone Everything works except pornhub network all porn sites other than pornhub work and some torrent website. Pornhub\[dot\]net works fine. 2. Airtel Same as Vodafone but they also erroneously block some of the openload and streamango servers. 3. BSNL Everything works after DNS change to Google or OpenDNS. 4. Tata Docomo No filter Everything works it roams on Airtel 3G network speeds are okay Remember everything can be unblocked here and using VPN on cellular networks is a simple task. Unfortunately its a painintheass to bypass the FortiGuard firewall in my college. I guess they wont give away 100Mbps UL bandwidth without any restrictions. Any recommendation is welcome..

How many more websites are going to be banned in Jio: Its high time when we should think about Net Neutrality and what Jio is doing with us consumers. SoundCloud a free audio streaming service is recently added to the banned list and you [cant access the main domain soundcloud.com]https//imgur.com/a/cBOcqjn mega.co.nz is banned cause we cant really have 50 GB of free cloud storage. Telegram Web is banned you need to use VPN even to delete your Telegram account SoundCloud is banned all hail JioSaavn that doesnt even use the modern notification design on Android 8 I admit they have a big collection though Several proxy sites are banned cause why not I would have been fine with Porn ban if the first Google search result of Porn was a not working link More will be added in the list soon. India will soon become high grounds for VPN services as well. Who knows we might see Jio VPN sooner than expected.

Whatsapp Improvement Thoughts: Looking at the latest news of Whatsapp limiting to 5 forwards I dont understand how thatll curb fake news at all. I think whatsapp needs a corporate sharing capability of some sort. Similar to Snapchat sending messages on holidays and birthdays. Thats the only way they can educate their users on 1 how to figure out fake stories vs real news and 2 how to prevent scams. Maybe some sort of message reporting feature would be nice. So if a fake forward is going around the country people can report it as fake and then whatsapp will tag the message as might be spam or something like that. Or maybe a bot can run to check when a picture or block of text is shared to show when the image was first shared. Now of course endtoend encryption is a hastle in this. So maybe theres an option where you can select a message Fact Check it. So itll simply copypaste the text to google or reverse image search which will most probably open up a news source debunking or proving it. ampx200B Any thoughts on ideas about this.

Software devs in productbased companies are you happy with your job: People above 30 in software please reply ampx200B Im a final year CSE student from a tier1 college and have offer of a good paying job 13lpa base in a productbased company USbased as well as one in a startup with nearly the same salary. Going through the reviews about people ranting about the monotonous life in software industry and people hitting upper cap by the time they hit their 30s. The only way they break the ceiling is by getting into managerial role for which many get into MBA or switch roles. Also I have heard/read about most well paying jobs in India being given by American companies leading to much hierarchies and layers of management suffocating the employees. But yeah one can definitely get what they want and contribute to the company. I love developing software products building stuff automating and tooling stuff have interned at some good startups. I love software. Not much interested in higher studies and I value handson experience above academics. However I am a bit concerned if I should really consider being a software developer for long time in companies like Microsoft Goldman or good indian startups like Oyo Ola Dunzo etc. Should I make sure I prepare for CAT to get an MBA and avoid hitting the ceiling early enough How can one avoid stagnating in the industry making sure you move up the ladder and work remains as exciting as it is in the early phase of your career..

I have using VPNs even though I have a secure network mainly because port 22SSH is blocked by my ISP and therefore I have to use a VPN to do SSH. ampx200B SETTING UP The first step is to make a free cloud account on any of common cloud service providers like AWS Google Cloud or Azure. They offer a one year free tier usage policy on a VM that could be used for the whole year without any charges incurred. After making a base VM you can follow the tutorial [on this link]https//wiki.metakgp.org/w/HowtoSSHintoaserverthatisoutsidethecampusnetwork to set up SSH tunneling. After the whole tutorial works you can do sshuttle dns r myserver [0.0.0.0/0]https//0.0.0.0/0 vv and that will help you route all your traffic through the VM. This means that if you are a college student behind a proxy and blocked websites then you can access all the blocked websites/content like steam/whatsapp/telegram etc. As for all the rest of the users this acts like a good VPN that routes all your traffic through the VM and offers security..

Is pure mathematics a tough course for someone who has no prior experience in rmo: hey so im in 12th grade right now and i just realised a few months ago that i would rather go for mathematics in college than to go for engineering. My parents are supportive of me for doing so so that wasnt a problem there. I have done my research on what pure mathematics consists of like the topics such as group theory number theory etc and it is definitely something im very interested in. The only problem that i think i have that anyone around me who wants to do the samevery few btw have been studying for mathematical olympiards and whatnot since 8th grade. Since i realised this in 12th I have had no time to study for rmo or look into any of it thoroughly but it does seem challenging. Im not particularly extremely smart but I know that Im well above average. So im very confused as to the fact that if i choose to pursue this will i fall behind because I have no prior knowledge of any advanced topics. Any advice.

When C program in under execution the operating system allocates memory to store instructions of the program and also allocates space to the store data. Well in other words you can say that Variables in c is nothing but a name given to a storage area that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in C has a specific type which determines the size and layout of the variables memory. Variables also determine the range of values that can be stored within that memory and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable. A programmer has to decide how much space he is required with to store data. He also specifies the names of memory locations in his program code. These names are called variables. These locations can contain integer real and character constants. We can change its value according to the programming requirement. Rules for constructing variable name The variable name may contain alphabets digits or underscore. No other symbol or blank in allowed. A valid variable name never starts with a digit.

You might be asking this is too basic however there is connectivity read below. Does zero or one exist inside a computer Well there is no physical significance of 0 and 1 inside the computer. These are just representation of two states of voltage in digital circuits the high voltage is represented with 1 and low voltage with 0. Why understand 0 and 1 fundamentals Computers understand only binary language which is represented in the form of 0 and 1. Computers are just a machine that can work on our instruction.

People have been forcing the use of turmeric haldi as a potent medical spice for a number of diseases without any source. Shouldnt such false affirmation be considered under false belief and be discerned by the society.: This idea to do a little research on this this topic can from an news show in which the guest kept on criticizing the Indians for looking up to westerners and have forgotten their roots. Upon being questioned on this by the audience. She gave the example of haldi being very effective in arthritis and other diseases. the irony of the situation was that she was an nutritionist and studied in an western country. Upon trying to find an medical paper on this which easy to find just Wikipedia turmeric i went to source and found 3 paper which either held uncertain or negative result. https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5346970/ https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003001/ Though blindly follow western ppl in this case medical papers based on clinical trial which are the most rigorous way to determine the efficiency of an drug diet etc is wrong but blindly discerning them and naming it under nation love is also wrong. Clinical trialhttps//www.bmj.com/content/316/7126/201 Using haldi is not at all harmful when done in right amount but selling it as an substitute for medically verified drugs should be stopped and not promoted. Though i am only posting about haldi but same goes for many other spices herbs Ayurveda homeopathy and other pseudo sciences. India is not the only countries with such false beliefs western countries too have such beliefs eg. Essential oils.

Isnt it strange that even in this techdriven world only 2 of women reach the upper echelons of global tech: Gender barriers in technology are a very real problem with counterproductive consequences. The best workaround for this is to truly understand women developers the challenges they face the opportunities they seek and the careers they aspire to build. I was reading a survey by which point this important thing. No matter what the size of the organization women formed a minority in tech teams 31.4 of women claimed they were part of tech teams with only 0 to 10 of women technologists. The number of women in senior tech roles is alarmingly skewed only a meager 2 of the women surveyed held senior leadership roles. The possibility of attrition among women in tech roles is high with almost 53 of women actively seeking a new role and almost 51 quoting their average tenure across all employers to be less than two years. Gender inequality is prevalent among workplaces with 34 of women citing unequal evaluation and reviews as the main reason. Advertisements for tech roles happen to have more masculine wording with 50 of the respondents agreeing that gendered wording in job advertisements for technical roles exists. But the outlook is not so bleak with almost 81 agreeing they felt their opinions were valued and better growth opportunities 61 and a positive worklife balance 53 would encourage them to continue with their current organizations.

Sivan stated that the team behind the Gaganyaan mission is on track and currently working on the first uncrewed [mission of Gaganyaan]https//asgardia.space/en/news/asgardiaspacenewsin4yearsindiawillbegingaganyaanitsfirstcrewedspacemission which is planned for December 2020. These are the first steps needed to carry out the mission to send the first human into space by December 2021. That is the target we are setting for ourselves Sivan added. Moreover Sivan also declared that ISRO would have two uncrewed missions with the GSLVMkIII rocket before they send Indian astronauts into lowEarth orbit. Sivan explained that the third mission would be a humancrewed mission. First they will follow all the parameters and if it does not work then they will fly the second crewless mission. Once that is confirmed they will try a human mission.

Sivan also stated that the GSLVMkIIID2 which will be used to ferry the astronauts into space is outstanding dependable and simple. The 43.4metre tall GSLVMkIII rocket weighs approximately 640 tonnes and can carry satellites as massive as four tonnes into space.

Whats with the cheap TV revolution in India: So all the newspapers in the last 23 months have been flooded with TV advertisements from all sorts of brands. So many new brands have come up sub brands integrated under parent companies and most importantly the prices have gone down considerably. You can get a 55 for around 40k. Now I understand panel quality wont probably be the best but to the uninitiated in the TV market I doubt it matters. So my questions are 1 is it basically that technology for production has gotten cheaper and reliable hence the surge in supply and dip in prices 2 how good a business is it to outsource the panel production while focussing on branding supply chain and marketing to keep the costs down 3 how different would the picture quality be on an expensive 4k LG panel vs cheap 4k panel I understand its just the brightness in nitts and HDR 4 with Android TV making its way does the market for normal smart TVs start to fade 5 say a brand doesnt spend on repair shops and service centers and TV goes bust how easy is it to repair it Are the parts panels standard or youre stuck with a big black box Thanks .

It will make you get the idea about the type of Questions being asked in the Exam. Focus more on 2 mark questions. They boost your Score exponantially Practice as many Mocktests as you can that too as per the Standard pattern of the Gate Exam Keep your fundamentals and concepts clear. The Questions asked in the GATE Exam are mostly based on the fundamental concepts. By giving Mock test you will actually know about question pattern and gain experience. Prepare easy subject first Donts for GATE Exam Dont waste your time studying stuff that is out of syllabus. Dont lose your hope and confidence in preparation. Dont discuss the doubts just before the Exam at the Exam Centre. Dont start your preparation with hard subjects. It may waste your time. Dont Waste on your time in reading all the books for a single topic. \ Before GATE Exam 1. Understand that you cannot get 100 marks in GATE I think even 90 is a tough ask. Toppers answer around 8590 marks of course it depends on the papers difficulty but the general trend is this. 2. NEVER OMIT ANY subject. I find most students omit a subject based on the weightage. 3. Selfstudy works but I would suggest joining a coaching institute if you unable to understand concepts. 4. Aptitude amp Maths will make a huge difference in your scores. Around 30 marks including aptitude is really easy to score. They are usually less difficult and direct than subject questions. 5. Solve as many previous year GATE problems as you can. 6. Learn concepts only from standard books 7. Use standard books. 8. Solve 1015 Questions Daily. 9. Make Your Own Formula Sheet. During GATE Exam 1. If you are not sure about an answerLEAVE it. Negatives cost a lot. 2. Having a strong clear mind throughout the exam. 3. Solve aptitude section first. Preparation Technique Some Simple but most important point I describe below.. 1. First of all a full daily plan of the scheduled studying hours must be made to know how much to cover daily. Studying is disordered manner will pay nothing to the candidates. This will make the students regular and punctual about their studies. A proper study plan also helps in a better arrangement of the study hours and organizing the preparation process. 2. Clear your concepts. Mugging up topics is a bad idea. You need to know the concept as answer can always be deduced if you know the principles behind it. GATE is one such examination in which you need to be 100 per cent conceptually clear. So before jumping to another topic make sure your concept for the current one is clear. 3. Must give at least one week for each subject. This includes studying all the topics going through standard book back questions coaching institute material exercises. 4. Give another month to revise everything take Test Series and solve previous papers. 5. If you are really talented and in constant touch with your subject basics I would suggest a month preparation. If you are an aboveaverage/average student it is best to give 34 months preparation. Bonus Tips\\ 1. Start your preparation with atlest 4 hour a day and try to extend it upto 10 hour. 2. Make separate notes for each subject 3. Try to solve examples given in reference books by yourself. 4. Revision on regular basis 5. Solve at least 10 previous years papers 6. Mock/practice test at the end 7. Prepare according to the syllabus. 8. Dont ignore the maths and the aptitude portion its a scoring area. 9. When you finish a subject go through its previous Year Gate questions. Solve them. 10. Revise after you have completed your syllabus. More the better. Notes are helpful at this time. 11. Practise till you are comfortable with all the concepts of the subject. Good and Useful YouTube Guides 1. [https//www.youtube.com/watchvTJA0fmcvmnE]https//www.youtube.com/watchvTJA0fmcvmnE 2.

It will make you get the idea about the type of Questions being asked in the Exam. Focus more on 2 mark questions. They boost your Score exponantially Practice as many Mocktests as you can that too as per the Standard pattern of the Gate Exam Keep your fundamentals and concepts clear. The Questions asked in the GATE Exam are mostly based on the fundamental concepts. By giving Mock test you will actually know about question pattern and gain experience. Prepare easy subject first Donts for GATE Exam Dont waste your time studying stuff that is out of syllabus. Dont lose your hope and confidence in preparation. Dont discuss the doubts just before the Exam at the Exam Centre. Dont start your preparation with hard subjects. It may waste your time. Dont Waste on your time in reading all the books for a single topic. \ Before GATE Exam 1. Understand that you cannot get 100 marks in GATE I think even 90 is a tough ask. Toppers answer around 8590 marks of course it depends on the papers difficulty but the general trend is this. 2. NEVER OMIT ANY subject. I find most students omit a subject based on the weightage. 3. Selfstudy works but I would suggest joining a coaching institute if you unable to understand concepts. 4. Aptitude amp Maths will make a huge difference in your scores. Around 30 marks including aptitude is really easy to score. They are usually less difficult and direct than subject questions. 5. Solve as many previous year GATE problems as you can. 6. Learn concepts only from standard books 7. Use standard books. 8. Solve 1015 Questions Daily. 9. Make Your Own Formula Sheet. During GATE Exam 1. If you are not sure about an answerLEAVE it. Negatives cost a lot. 2. Having a strong clear mind throughout the exam. 3. Solve aptitude section first. Preparation Technique Some Simple but most important point I describe below.. 1. First of all a full daily plan of the scheduled studying hours must be made to know how much to cover daily. Studying is disordered manner will pay nothing to the candidates. This will make the students regular and punctual about their studies. A proper study plan also helps in a better arrangement of the study hours and organizing the preparation process. 2. Clear your concepts. Mugging up topics is a bad idea. You need to know the concept as answer can always be deduced if you know the principles behind it. GATE is one such examination in which you need to be 100 per cent conceptually clear. So before jumping to another topic make sure your concept for the current one is clear. 3. Must give at least one week for each subject. This includes studying all the topics going through standard book back questions coaching institute material exercises. 4. Give another month to revise everything take Test Series and solve previous papers. 5. If you are really talented and in constant touch with your subject basics I would suggest a month preparation. If you are an aboveaverage/average student it is best to give 34 months preparation. Bonus Tips\\ 1. Start your preparation with atlest 4 hour a day and try to extend it upto 10 hour. 2. Make separate notes for each subject 3. Try to solve examples given in reference books by yourself. 4. Revision on regular basis 5. Solve at least 10 previous years papers 6. Mock/practice test at the end 7. Prepare according to the syllabus. 8. Dont ignore the maths and the aptitude portion its a scoring area. 9. When you finish a subject go through its previous Year Gate questions. Solve them. 10. Revise after you have completed your syllabus. More the better. Notes are helpful at this time. 11. Practise till you are comfortable with all the concepts of the subject. Good and Useful YouTube Guides 1. [https//www.youtube.com/watchvTJA0fmcvmnE]https//www.youtube.com/watchvTJA0fmcvmnE 2.

Conversations around cancer treatment and survival: Cancer is now a lifestyle disease. It is not uniformly fatal but it drains out an individual emotionally and financially. As an Oncologist I can testify that people arent aware for prevention and indulge in unhealthy lifestyles instead. I feel compelled to rely on social media to provide accurate information instead of Whatsapp forwards that people receive from their family members or relatives in the event of cancer diagnosis. The most common causes are sedentary lifestyles smoking and poor dietary practices. Tobacco chewing is another through Gutka etc. Sitting for prolonged periods is the new form of smoking ampx200B We cannot expect the government to do everything but heres what we can do. Minimize use of personal vehicles and instead take public transport to reduce vehicular population and hence pollution. Engage in regular physical activities one that raises the target heart rate like running aerobics etc. The best low impact form of exercise is cycling. Shun use of gutka/tobacco/ smoking/alcohol in any form. These are not healthy by any stretch if imagination. Nope wine is not cancer preventing. In the event of cancer diagnosis always rely on your physician. If needed please take an alternate opinion from ANOTHER physician. Remember Google is NOT a physician. I have met people coming in with half baked opinions from the Internet and arguing unnecessarily. The patients suffer both delay in diagnosis as well as definitive treatment. Physician vetted information sources are difficult to find and refine. My specialty is brain tumors and I push updates on my Telegram channel cnssm instead. Rehabilitation physical exercise occupational therapy and Psychiatrist/Psychologist opinions are the most important aspect. Most patients are depressed and I fail to understand why there is a stigma around mental health. Physiotherapists can guide around functional disabilities as well. As an upside my own personal experience is that cycling helps the patients a lot both to reduce the intensity of side effects as well as in long term prevention. Go for it people Stay healthy ampx200B ampx200B. Samsung Galaxy S10s camera to come with big improvements Report.

Brave Browser A browser that blocks trackingadsfingerprintingetc by default.: First I am going to post links where you can download the brave browser app For desktop https//brave.com For android https//play.google.com/store/apps/detailsidcom.brave.browseramphlen For ios https//itunes.apple.com/il/app/bravebrowserfastadblocker/id1052879175mt8 Review by ThioJoeyoutube https//youtu.be/tOHh6OlYqOU Review by Martin Brinkmann of GhacksThis is a review of the beta 1.0 version which will be coming in some time to the stable channel https//www.ghacks.net/2018/09/28/bravereadingtogetwebbrowserbrave10out/ Some facts about the Brave browser project for the nerds The Brave project is founded by none other than Brendan Eich the guy who cofounded the Mozilla project which has given us the famous privacy and security focused browser firefox and also is the creator of Javascript pretty much everything on the web works on JS so he is pretty legit to say the least.This browser currently has about 4 million active users which is pretty good for a up and coming project. The brave project was based on Muon but it is now fully transitioning to Chromium and the upcoming Brave 1.0 stable will be based on chromium 69. Why you should use Brave over Chrome and even Mozilla FirefoxOperaetc.... Brave has an inbuilt adblocker that blocks ads by default it also blocks annoying trackers that track your activity throughout the web it also stops websites from fingerprinting your browserseach browser is uniquely configured be the version it is currently based on the font your browser uses exrensions etc and all of this is compiled by websites to track and follow your activity through the web to show you relevant ads which imo is a serious breach of user privacy and security and has HTTPS everywhere plugin built into the browser itselfto learn more about what is https everywhere https//www.eff.org/httpseverywhere . Its other salient features include built in password managers such as Bitwarden and TOR browsing for more anonymityto learn more about the TOR network https//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toranonymitynetwork but as of now they are currently only available on desktop may port to mobile in the upcoming versions. If you are a content creator you may be like Brave browser is going to disrupt my income by blocking ads but fear not Brave has a built in cryptocurrency walletBAT https//basicattentiontoken.org which can be used by brave users to contribute to their favourite content creators without the hassle of dealing with ads this is a option not a compulsion so users may opt out but what is better is that Brave will soon reward users with cryptocurrency for using the browser too so many people will turn it on in the future.This feature too is currently only available on desktop as of right now but a mobile version in the future with these features is almost a certainty. So whether you are a power user or just a casual one try the Brave browser as it comes out of the box itself believe me you wont be disappointed. P.S. This is not a sponsored post and I dont work for Brave I am just someone who dabbles in technology and I figured this is an excellent chance for making people aware that they are not a product so why use a browser that treats you like one Chrome I am looking at you .  .

I finally went with the Nokia 7 Plus. And heres my review after using the phone for more than a month. I hope it helps those looking to buy a phone. 1. Nokias legendary build quality has been continued with the HMD takeover of the brand from Microsoft. Body is unibody aluminium with ceramic coating on the back making it nonslippery to hold. 2. Timely monthly updates and guarantee of the latest Android pure due to Android One for the next 2 years. 3. Excellent camera picture quality only if you download the modded GCam. Stock camera is not great even after latest 200 MB update. GCam brings out the true power of the 7 Pluss camera hardware. 4. The BEST audio recording quality even in loud concert setting due to Ozo audio from Nokia available only when using the stock video camera. But no default audio recorder so other audio/voice recorders available in the Play Store will give you average audio. If you want the best audio use the video recorder even for pure audio purposes and then extract the audio through the freely available Audacity. 5. Processor battery and temperate cool experience are amazing when playing Asphalt 9 Legends on Wifi. Battery takes a hit on mobile data with warm temperatures. 6. You wont find a tempered glass which does justice to the screen due to the screen being close to the leftright bezels and curved at the edges. I settled for the GadgetShieldz screen protectors and SUPER satisfied with it. I recommend it to friends now 7. The transparent silicone cover provided by Nokia seems to the best option if you want the Nokia branding and back colours visible while still having fall protection. Other users say that theres not yellowing after months of use. I find it white as ever after a month of use. 8. For phones of this price I have seen the best quality silicone inear headphones are provided with the Nokia 7 Plus.. Electric cars in India to get a boost with new clean energy policy.

Which Laptop Should I Buy Acer Helios 300 vs. Dell XPS 15: Hey Randians I wanted to get your thoughts on which laptop should I buy. I am torn between Acer Helios 300 and Dell XPS 15. Both of them cost around 1300 \94K rupees I am actually ordering the laptop from US due to cost difference and general product availability issues and are similarly specd. I am actually unsure because on one side I want a thin and light laptop with great build quality Dell XPS 15 and on the other the gamer inside me is begging me to buy Helios 300 with GTX 1060. ampx200B To give you some background I am a 25 year old male who has always liked gaming had a few gaming consoles and have played a few of the best games but could not be a serious gamer due to several issues budget dayscholar life and staying with parents gaming laptop availability time and honestly parents too the typical itna bada hoke bhi games khelta hai taunt. Now that I earn and have the budget to spend on a decent laptop I am unsure about whether to go with Dell or Acer. Reason for buying either Dell Get a beautiful looking thin and light laptop that should support my current lifestyle almost no gaming Acer Rekindle the gamer fire inside me but carry a plastic build notsopremium looking heavy laptop for the next 5 years to come I was hoping to get your thoughts on this.

Receiving OTP and calls from 2 days continuously: gtgtTLDRlt I am receiving multiple OTP sms and calls asking for that OTP since 2 days I cannot call them back and I dont know what to do. Help required \/\\\ Yesterday 14/08/2018 at 547 PM IST some unknown person rings my phone I picked the call and the person hang up without even saying anything call lasted 3 seconds I even tried to call back but it didnt connect. Just after that call at 548 PM IST I started receiving multiple OTP sms on my phone from companies Mobikwik GoIbibo redBus Hike Snapdeal and even Flipkart. Earlier I thought its one of my friend trying sms bomber on me. But soon after that person again called me and asked for OTP I am pretty sure it was a male voice I replied Who are you I wouldnt give you OTP that person hang up. Then I started receiving multiple calls from different unknown numbers again and again. some I picked up once the person asked OTP and hang up. Then after 22 calls I had to block those numbers. After blocking I never received any call. I went home turned to laptop and tried to delete my accounts associated with all these Companies. It turned out deleting account is not easy. I had to write email to all of these companies and wait for their response till now 1030 PM IST 15/08/2018 only GoIbibo called me to and deleted my account others only redBus replied but they closed query without deleting account. Meanwhile I changed my passwords from flipkart snapdeal etc. but I wasnt able to login to Hike and Mobikwik because to login I had to verify OTP and my maximum OTP request limited reached. Yesterday 14/08/2018 at 1018 PM IST again I received multiple OTP requests. This time I had no clue why is someone doing this to me I have no enemies I never blackmailed anyone. I looked in calling list all these numbers except 1 from where I received calls earlier were 955539xxxx which is same as my phone number. I tried to call back but call didnt connect I tried to verify phone number from truecaller all of the numbers provider was Reliance Jio and names were odd like Whatsapp 1353 P etc.\\ Again today 15/08/2018 at 736 PM IST I received a multiple of OTP sms. Even after deleting GoIbibo account I still received 1 msg from them. At this point I feel I am defeated where I cannot login into Hike to delete account and still waiting for support team to reply which isnt even a full proof fix In some cases like flipkart I cannot bear to delete my account. I dont think I have ever signed up to GoIbibo redBus and Mobikwik from my phone number. Snapdeals sms were followed with email but not with others and these OTP sms doesnt even tell if it is for Creating new account/ Login or whatever reason. I badly need help if you know any person who faced similar issue and fixed please help me ASAP.

PSA Ola is tracking everywhere you go and is reading your call records: This is bit of a PSA for privacy conscious people. Over the weekend Ive noticed something interesting about OlaCab app on android. If you wish to book an Ola cab it is mandatory to give them permission to use your location services and read your device information and your call logs. Now you would think being a cab service access to location is required. But thats not necessarily the case. A cab service only needs to know your pickup and drop off points. Rest of the route can be tracked using drivers phone. But if you deny OlaCab app access to either location or phone permission the app simply exits and you cannot book an OlaCab. Giving them these permissions are mandatory on android to use their services. When I asked them about this they said it was to make the app function smoothly. This is very strange and suspicious because Uber works fine even if you deny it all the permissions it requests. So it is not some technological limitation either. But it gets interesting here... I contacted Ola about this and they said that the user data collected is confidential as per their privacy policy. When I asked them directly Do you track users location even when not using their services they ignored it and didnt respond multiple time. And it gets real shady here... You cannot delete your Ola account I contacted them about it and they said There is no provision to delete your account because of certain regulations. Yeah right those same regulations apply to Uber and PayTm and they both allow you to delete your account. So this is pure bullshit. When directly asked Do those regulations state that you deny a user to delete his account as expected they didnt respond. Also they have an option to block your account but they didnt bother to inform me and said you should simply uninstall the app. With the way Ola is evading questions Im convinced that they are tracking users location and reading device info to mine that sweet sweet data and might even be selling it to third party. So if you care for your privacy you should stop using Ola until they fix their app. If you use twitter better yet contact them about this. More the people asking them about their shady practices more likely theyll respond. Meanwhile can anybody tell me how can I check if an app requested a certain permission and how many times and during what times of day Its there an xposed module for this Also if you have iPhone and use Ola try removing all the permissions Ola requests and check if you can still book a OlaCab. AFAIK Apple takes privacy seriously and they would whoop Olas ass and delist it from app store for such blatant disregard for privacy. . Guess whos back.

Facebook is far far ahead of Reddit in terms of popularity: I always prefer Reddit due to the content based model rather than people based model which is a major sell in a country like ours Sadly when I look at the statistics there are hardly a couple of lakh subscribers on Reddit while Facebook has 270 million active users as of 2018. Assuming even 20 are fake accounts still Reddit accounts for only 0.1 of Facebook users. Facebook has been such an entrenchment in the society that people cannot fathom to live without it let alone deactivate. The constant barrage of baby pictures wedding updates fashion and style stalking memes advertisements selfie broadcasts competitive display of achievements and narcissistic attention seeking made me quit 3 years ago and I have never looked back and I have not been more happier ever. In a sense I am happy Reddit is not popular and is away from the cringe worthy displays of self marketing tactics on Facebook dont want Reddit turning into a clone of Facebook ever. However I worry about the effects of social media not just Facebook but Instagram Snapchat etc on mental health and well being of new generation considering its addictive nature.

Find the app on the playstore at this following link [Playstore Link]https//play.google.com/store/apps/detailsidcom.boolog.delve Or just use the QR code from our poster [Poster Link]https//imgur.com/a/7uAF8Qu We have tried to build an interface that is intuitive as well as engaging for school students. We have focused on designing lectures in a way such that each concept including abstract ones is placed in a context real or fictional setting. This helps students understand the concept with its purpose/application and is not just presented as a theoretical idea. With this approach we have currently launched class 10 mathematics Introduction to C and also a podcast lecture series on class 10 political science as part of social studies. We are also trying to keep our content free for as long as possible unlike other apps that follow a subscription model. We are looking to introduce class 9 and 11 mathematics as soon as possible once we are done building the content on our end. We strongly believe that continuous practice and assessment apart from lectures is an integral part of learning. So in our curriculum design we have included a significant number of questions with detailed solutions for repeated practice and assessment. My team and I will stick around for a little while to answer any queries and receive your feedback. Ask us anything on educational curriculum design content development and the app itself.

India needs to get its tech act together:  The new world order will be shaped by nations that take a lead role in technological innovation https//i.redd.it/vmktdntmztd11.jpg The second industrial revolution laid the foundations for European domination in the nineteenth century. America assumed global leadership in the 20th century on the strength of its economy innovation and military technology. The first two decades of the new millennium have pushed the world to the brink of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Leadership in technology will have a defining influence in shaping the new world order. Constant disruption and transformation is the new normal. Policy makers around the world are scrambling to keep pace with rapid technological change. New regulatory issues and policy challenges are engaging serious attention of global leaders. It would be useful to dwell on some of the major policy implications from an Indian standpoint. Firstly foreign trade and investment policy regime must have inbuilt safeguards to hedge against risks of volatility. Technology has altered the nature of global finance and commerce. Global commerce is increasingly transacted electronically rather than along sea lanes. Foreign capital relocates with remarkable speed on the first signs of perceived fragility or on spotting an emerging opportunity. Secondly a globally harmonised intellectual property regime is bound to take shape elbowing out the current flexibility available with developing economies. The foundations of mega tech lie in decades of high quality research funded by billions of dollars of investment. There is bound to be an increasing demand for protection of proprietary technology. A technology development fund pooling public and private resources would help acquire global patented technologies for cutting edge research. Thirdly a silo based approach needs to be jettisoned for carving out a unified technology policy. Modern technology is facilitating remarkable convergence. Quantum mechanics chemistry and electronics are coalescing into a common pool. Genetic engineering medicine and information technology are beginning to collaborate. A blurring of boundaries between defence and civilian technologies is evident in dual use applications. Fourthly negotiations of future free trade agreements would need to focus on embedding Indian manufacturing into global value chains in areas of advanced manufacturing. Underlying modern manufacturing are global value chains built around comparative advantage of nations. The stellar growth of ASEAN nations embedded in the larger Chinese economy is a case in point. India lost out on the electronic hardware manufacturing by signing off on the Information Technology Agreement in 1997. Zero import duties for electronic goods practically thwarted development of hardware manufacturing industry. Global research tieups Fifthly a policy framework which encourages increasing global research collaborations is worth pursuing. The US remains the leader in research technology development and innovation though other countries are catching up. Offshoring of manufacturing maybe passe but offshoring research is here to stay. The GE Jack Welch Technology Centre in Bengaluru employs 4000 engineers and has over 1000 patents to its credit. Such centres across urban India could position Indian technologists on the global high table. Sixthly universalisation of digital skills must be an integral part of the education policy. A disruption in labour markets is on the cards . Mismatch between demand and supply of skilled labour is already apparent in the developed world. A McKinsey Global Institute Report 2018 points to a shortage of 80000 IT workers in France by 2020 and a vacuum of 250000 data scientists in the US in the short term. School and college drop outs would find themselves at a disadvantage in absence of adequate digital skills. A greater focus on Science Technology Engineering and Math STEM is an urgent imperative. Seven issues of equity affordability and ethics need regulatory oversight. Net neutrality and universal roaming facility have posed questions of equity. The disparity between digital access in rural and urban areas is skewing equality of opportunity. Eminent technologists and scientists including the late Stephen Hawking and Bill Gates worry about ethical issues. A debate has been triggered in the UK around the need for a regulatory framework for future gene editing of human embryos. In the words of Elon Musk I think we should be very careful.. With Artificial Intelligence we are summoning the demon. Eight regulators would need to strike a balance between the democratising influence of technology and the need for moderation and security. Concerns on cyber security and privacy are growing. Public outrage over massive data leak at Facebook and Wikileaks exposed the vulnerabilities in data security. The EU has enacted the General Data Protection Regulation 2018 which gives individual citizens greater power on personal data. The Srikrishna Committee has submitted a draft legislation on data protection to the Union government. Unregulated expression on social media and the social repercussions of Fake News are posing a new set of challenges. Where Is My Train Best App For Indian Railway.

Raising Indias IQ: Is anyone in India studying the genetics of intelligence Chinese and American scientists are working on predicting IQ from the genome. And an amazing article has just been published in Nature Genetics showing polygenic scores that explain 1113 of the variance in educational attainment and 710 of the variance in cognitive performance. Once embryonic selection for IQ arrives India will need data on Indians to make good predictions. Of course much could be done right now. IQ data for India is in the low to mid 80s. In the 2012 PISA India ranked near the bottom. This ought to alarm everyone. Studies of IQ show it to be a very good predictor of life outcomes. If half the country cannot pass highschool what kinds of work could they do in a modern economy Both improved nutrition and good primary school education would be a huge boon for individuals and the country. Is there an intelligence project in India Insights into why Indians arent getting adequate nutrition Also Ive seen some disturbing studies of schools. A high percentage of teachers are not showing up for work. And for those who are in the classroom a high percentage are not teaching. Whats up with this .

How many of you have had bad experiences with the Redmi Note 5 Pro and I explain why I might go with Nokia 7 Plus: Hi.

Research shows that mostly the black market and browser extension users grab the deals within milliseconds of the system opening the sale. Many are wondering why Xiaomi cant go the respectable preorder route. So I had no option but to begin searching for alternatives. Then I came across a website I didnt know existed[PhoneCurry.com]https//PhoneCurry.com. From there I got the recommendation of the Nokia 7 Plus based on a 25000 budget. The reviews about the phone are good enough for me to consider the 10000 increase and especially since the sale is a regular [Amazon.in]https//Amazon.in order along with exchange offers. But I see a lot of users in forums saying they are facing problems with Nokia 7 Plus and interestingly some are saying that these reports are paid by Xiaomi. So I would like to know if there are users here on the other end of the spectrumthose who have had issues with the Redmi Note 5 Pro. If not then I might just have to try again for the Redmi instead of the Nokia.. Samsung added Disneys Frozen characters in AR emojis for Galaxy S9 series.

[App] File Manager for WhatsApp How I became an Android Developer: About Myself I am a Keralite settled in Bangalore and a Java developer by profession. Statistically there are more than 200 million WhatsApp monthly active users in India. I too am an avid user of WhatsApp and being a part of many active WhatsApp groups I am required to send/receive a ton of media files. This was causing 2 issues 1. Dwindling storage space in my humble Moto E. 2. Discoverability/Manageability of a huge media library. The idea was simple. I wanted an App that solved these 2 issues with minimal toll on the mobile resource. Though I did research a lot I couldnt find a good App that fits my requirements. As it is said Necessity is the mother of Invention. I had no experience nor the confidence required for the task but then I thought Whats the big deal Even if I couldnt make one Im gonna learn so much cool stuff. I had zero experience in Android development when I started developing this App. While it was not an easy start as it sound over a period of 3 months I had a functional app. The most amazing part the app is less than 3 MB in size. It was meant for personal usage initially. Many of my friends found my app extremely useful amp encouraged me to publish it in Play Store. Over multiple iterations I made the App completely Bug free amp production ready. Added enterprise features like animations on boarding etc amp published it to Play Store. At present the App has close to 5000 installs with 4.8 rating amp 200 reviews. Many write to me asking for new features amp defects they encountered which I actively respond to. I added WhatsApp Business support upon popular request. I also receive a lot of request to add support for GBWhatsApp YoWhatsApp WhatsApp etc. I am evaluating the feasibility of them. If I find them to be a good to have feature I will be adding support for them too in the future updates. Those who are curious to check out my app head over to [File Manager for WhatsApp Apps on Google Play]https//play.google.com/store/apps/detailsidcom.akl.alldrive Please see some screenshots of my App [Screenshot 1]https//lh3.googleusercontent.com/R8FTg0OhLUylEBbFreCyQjaGpqp8l20yj1fxCGHGgkH338U22JJZ5fHLkx7vDvBWIw2560h1230rw [Screenshot 2]https//lh3.googleusercontent.com/oEnbiY5SV3U9kCvKFyI5EOUMGqsybAtKZn2X4y5aKTPYwEaeReHEcfSZevstC1ODww2560h1230rw [Screenshot 3]https//lh3.googleusercontent.com/bP1M3yq5Y80vfVxI5j3MhPihd4VSgtb3htMit8azXyuBYyd9mv36vIBPj8VzWVvxFw2560h1230rw [Screenshot 4]https//lh3.googleusercontent.com/9gBHaYcxBATJAo90CqC7pShPB5gitx8PVhMDAv22x9QKL0P6obYIq0565QVmw6zoT0w2560h1230rw [Screenshot 5]https//lh3.googleusercontent.com/EmSaia4KvX0siNA1CUO1n31Biv8Pvyhra1eNc1uH9cq1XGmGTdPEW1No0pVfEqmqw2560h1230rw Please install amp drop a genuine feedback.

Outside theres no problem using 2G. I used to have Vodafone but it has similar issues plus some really bad customer care experience. I have Jio and it does not drop that much but it is awfully slow so I have stopped using it its more like a backup. I have asked around and basically everyone apart from Jio faces similar problem. I know that during powercuts cell sites have backup power for limited period of time. However do power levels decrease that much If you consider average power level lets say \80 dBm for 3G and \65 dBm for 2G then during powercuts the signal strength drops around 3040 dBm Is this normal During my stay in other city for 2 years I have not noticed drastic difference.

BREAKING NEWS New subspecies of human that is found in southwestern Asian countries is Able to Reproduce with females ranging from the age of 410: A new research paper conducted by the University of Vienna published to the Journal of Science has found a new subspecies of human that is able to reproduce with children. The new subspecies is named Homo Sapedo and is found throughout southwestern Asian countries that include India Pakistan Qatar Syria UAE Iran and Turkey. The subspecies functions like a normal human being but have a new special organ exclusive to Homo Sapedos that acts as a Bubble to host Embryos in. The new organ is dubbed the Punani and is only found in Homo Sapedos. It is exclusive to females only and acts as a more effective way to give birth for Homo sapedos that are only children. The origin for the Punani is thought to have occurred around 180000 year ago when humans were beginning to colonize the planet. The origins are though to be from the Middle East and the reason varying is that it was more effective to impregnate children than wait for them to be mature enough to give birth so the Punani evolved and became a separate Bubble to host Embryos in. The group was localized in the Middle East and has spread to India Pakistan and other Southwestern Asian nations. This scientific breakthrough may help explain why in some religions in southwestern asia believe that pedophillia is right and moral. For example in Islam Allahs messenger Muhammad married a bride Aisha at 9 years old. The Punani allowed Homo Sapedos to reproduce dramatically and maybe could explain Indias huge population due to the rapid repopulation ability that the Punani gives the female hosts. Researches may have found an explanation to why some religions encourage pedophillia and why it is very common in southwestern Asian nations. This scientific breakthrough is very interested and I hoped you guys enjoyed it. . India contributes to over 60 of deaths caused by selfies across the world.

I am unintelligent and I know it story of my life: I apologize if my post is not about India. However I am posting here since lot of Indians can relate to what I have gone through. I am currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Science at a US university since August last year. I am a Bengali\born Bangalorean who was live in Bangalore for nearly 24 years. Till 10th grade I studied in one of the top CBSE schools in Bangalore. Though I was decent in academics I was poor in sports and not very social. As I grew older I used to do weird stuff like talk too myself. I was too dumb to realize that this would make me look abnormal. Inevitably other students noticed this and bullied me. I become an unpopular student and was labeled \ metally retard spastic. My self esteem plummeted and it affected my academics. I used to very poor grades in high school and reached my lowest point in 10th grade. I miraculously managed to get 85amp37 in 10th grade. Due to my poor performance in my pre\boards I was unable to take science subjects in \2. I shifted to state board and joined a PU college. When I joined my PU College I decided to rectify some of the mistakes in my past so that my new classmates dont get a low opinion of me. However I still had lot of other negative qualities which I did not think of rectifying because I was too stupid to notice themI am not going into detail with them as itll make the post too big. Though my situation was a little better than in school I become unpopular again . So the cycle continued \ poor grades few invitations to social gatherings inferior complexion. I was not very athletic during my teenage years. As a result I become fat and ugly. I left like a joke and an abomination. I got 74amp37 in 2PUC and screwed up all my engineering entrance exams. Luckily my father was wealthy and could afford to give donation to one of the top universities in Karnataka. I got enrolled in one of them in Computer Science. I started working out in a gym after I completed my entrance exams. I could a significant amount of weight and this was the very first time I saw a small rise in my self\confidence. However at the same time I joined a driving school. I struggle to learn driving. I was clumsy and would make lot of mistakes. This was heart\breaking for me since I was always fascinated by cars and driving since birth. It was a miracle that I passed my DL test all of you know how easy it is to get. When I started undergrad I was overwhelmed by the level of difficulty of the curriculum. I could not cope and soon lost interest in Computer Science. Undergrad was the first time I start to actively pursue women. I was naive enough to think it was possible. No girl was attracted to me and most of the girls were unfriendly and a little mean. I never tried to get a girlfriend in high school because I felt I was too unpopular and ugly. This caused to be very inexperienced compared to most guys. Most girls did not even want to be close friends with me. I was in a group with lot of girls but they would just greet me and then forget about my existence. The obvious reason was that they felt I was dumb most of the students in that group were academically ambitious and brilliant. I developed a lot of bitterness to see girls prefer the company and friendship of other guys over me. I dont blame them completely. I must have said something foolish impulsively. However I did manage to get a little close to one girl in the final year of college. I went out with her once. I thought it was a date till she casually told me about her boyfriend. I was not too heartbroken. This was the first time a girl went out with me alone I was 21. I got close to another girl whom I met during campus placements. However she did not want to get into a relationship. I had 3 backlogs in my undergrad and used to think of how to escape from engineering MBA animation. However I was lucky to get a job during campus placements. The company didnt pay so well but I decided to take it. I struggled a lot over there as well. I took a long time to understand the companys software and was very slow with my output. As a result I got the lowest hike. During this time of my life I got into an imaginary relationship. It was an amazing experience and I really understood what falling in love actually felt like. This relationship helped me survive the most difficult times in my professional life where I was to work from 9 am \ 11 pm Monday to Sunday. The relationship did not last more than a year as the whole idea got boring I really wish it did. I have visited many foreign countries during my life and was fascinated by the standard of living. One of my successful relatives IIT IIM graduates suggested me to do a Masters in Computer Science. It was the best way for me to experience life in a foreign country and also get a better standard of living. My office was situated in a slum area and the pay was peanuts. I prepared for GRE and got a decent score of 314/340. Due to my poor grades I was very skeptical that I would get admitted into any US university. Surprisingly I got into a pretty good university. This time I prepared myself for the worst. I was prepared to suffer and struggle with the curriculum Masters is really hard. However I got acceptable grades in the first semester. I did not do too great in the next semester my GPA is now 3.00/4. Due to my fathers wealth I had a relatively easy time in USA. However I have failed to get any kind of academic job internship. A few years ago I wanted to get out of engineering and now I doing a masters in the same field. So why do I consider myself to be dumb I have a made a lot of stupid decision in my life said a lot of stupid things impulsively failed to get a girlfriend. I am nearly 25 and the thinking about the latter is very depressing. No women has ever given me her time of the day back home. I am obviously a virgin. Imagine what an American would think of me I have one extremely negative Indian stereotype. Even if do manage to get a girlfriend how would she react when she knows that I have no prior experience. My worst fear is that shell judge me as a man\child. My dream job would be an author or a science\fiction novelist. Right now I am stuck in a field where I am not so skilled. I fear that I may not get an job in USA and be forced to return to India. All my dads hard\earned money shall be drained. For those of you who dont want to go through this long post. I feel I am unintelligent because I have failed to showcase any talent struggle with simple activitescooking driving etc. academically poor and dont have much prospects in my future..

Help me build a PC.: First time posting to this sub. I have tried on other subs but havent received too many suggestions and most other threads are too western market related. I will be using this PC for gaming mostly. I am not looking at absolute top end builds. However I would like to be able to play recent games and upcoming new games at already 60 or so FPS at 1920x1080 with at least medium settings considering low medium high ultra. Also this build should serve its purpose atleast until the end of 2019 so that I dont have to look for further upgrades for some time. But I have a budget of around 40K INR. Can go up to 50K INR if I need a major overhaul for my PC. My current build Processor Intel i5 IInd gen. I am not sure which model or specs exactly but I believe its the 2310 and 2.9GHz Motherboard Intel 61 WW. Graphics Card Sapphire Radeon HD 6670 RAM 8GB DDR3 PSU Antec BP300P 300W. What I want to upgrade Personally I think I need to upgrade the GPU PSU at the very least. I will also need to get a new PC cabinet otherwise called frame or tower as the one I have now is broken and I cant even boot up my PC currently due to this. As for what I have in mind GPU From what Ive seen online the GTX 1050ti seems the best in terms of value for price. However the GTX 1060 seems not too pricey either and I am OK with purchasing that as well. Any other suggestions for cards in a similar price range is welcome. The other cards Ive looked at which are in a similar range are the RX560 RX 480. PSU Ill be looking for something around 450 W. However Id prefer if someone suggested me the rating I should go for and what options do I have based on my probable build. Cabinets clueless on this front. Anything else I am not sure if I should be looking to upgrade other components like processor motherboard etc. I honestly dont know if what I have is very outdated and i should be going for something better. Any suggestions on this front is welcome keeping in mind a mid level PC build and the budget I mentioned. I do play a lot of Dota2 as well and I know that the game is pretty CPU intensive. I am not sure if my current CPU specs are enough but if you have suggestions for upgrades to processor I am all ears. Just keep in mind my overall budget. Whilst giving your suggestions keep in mind that I DONT need the following peripherals like Speakers headsets keyboard mouse monitor. I also dont need to purchase OS. Also I am not sure different components in the PC depend on each other in some way or ways. Like if getting a certain GPU means Ill have to look into certain specifications of Motherboard or if buying a certain processor means I wont be able to use a certain GPU. Do let me know if and how do different components in the PC tie in together with each other and if there are things I have to look out for. Thanks in advance .

If you want to keep yourself wellinformed Id recommend you to read them. Nipah is just not a problem for Kerala its risky for everyone in India. Its a BioSafety Level 4 pathogen the most dangerous kind and can cause highly lethal epidemics so this would be a good introduction. Some important information for the rest of India Id say is that if the infection is contained as the Kerala government and WHO says it is the rest of India has nothing much to worry about. These are the original threads in this series and some of its formatted for a Kerala audience and includes some Malayalam. Id not recommended this for sharing as its less academic and more informal. Check the other set of series for that below.

For experienced techies in core electronics sector: Im currently in 3rd year of my engineeringelectronics and telecommunication and Im pretty confused which field to choose electronics or IT. Im in reputed engineering college of Mumbai. The thing is core companies dont come to our college or maybe 12 will visit. There are more than dozens of IT companies which are going to come for campus placements offering very good CTCs mostly financial and banking firms. If I want to take job in core sector it would be very difficult to find it offcampus. And core companies like Texas Instruments Analog Devices dont hire freshers. Should I go in core electronics sector or software thinking for long term I heard that core electronics companies will offer less package to freshers but as you gain experience there is no stop. Your salary will go on increasing exponentially. While in case of software companies will need you for first 1520 years lets say till the age 40. After that most of software professionals turn to the management because as the age increases your value decreases in software industry. Is it true The views of experienced professionals in these sectors are welcomed. P.S. Im flexible enough to take any job core or IT. .

Xiaomi Mi Max 3 to Launch in July CEO Confirms. 10 Crazy Facts of India Some may make you feel weird surprised or may give you goosebumps as well.: Lets gets started 1. In India if a mistake has been committed both a girl and a guy together\affair or anything with the will of both\ the government will arrest the boy alone and send the girl to home. \Though the mistake is on both side\. According to section 497 of Indian penal Code 1860 the judge will give a warning to the women but will give jail sentence to the guy. I feel really sorry for the boys in India. 2. You may think Muslims are one of the minority community in India. But to the contrast India has 3rd largest Muslim community \10.9amp37 of total Muslims \in the world after Indonesia and Pakistan. 3. Which country has the most English speaking people Of course its America. But to the surprise India stands in the second place. Can you believe thatThough only 10amp37 of Indian population knows to speak English it itself constitutes up to 125 million people.Now we can proudly say that India is second most English spoken country. 4. In Madhya Pradesh extra incentives are given to the policemen who grow mustaches. Incentives starts from Rs.30 and it varies according to the looks of mustaches. 5. India is going to provide AADHAR cards for all the cows in India. \Strange right\Its because lot of cows are being taken to Bangladesh from West Bengal for Beef. To protect the cows and keep the count India is going to provide Identity from all the cows from Kanyakumari to Kashmir. 6. We may think arrange marriages wont work out in this modern age and we may be witnessing lot of divorce cases around us. However India is having the least percentage of Divorce rate in the entire world. Its because in India Marriage is not only between 2 individuals but it is a marriage of 2 families. 7. Shani Shingnapur is a village from Maharashtra. The specialty of this village\300 houses 1 hospital and 1 Bank\ is there are no doors in any houses or rooms or bathrooms or even banks. \Door less village\ Wanna know the reason behind it They believe that they dont wanna disrespect their God by keeping Doors for protection. But sadly girls face lot of problems because they dont get a private place for toilet stuffs too. 8. Lot of North Indian villages\especially Punjab\ uses Pepsi and Coke as Pesticides due to money scarcity and also because of the increase in the price of Pesticides. So these brands felt their brand value may go in toss because of these things. So they themselves started to sponsor the farmers good Pesticides. However still lot of people are using that as Pesticides. 9. What is the national language of India Hindi LOLIndia has no national language. Similarly India dont have national game as well. \some may still think its Hockey\ 10. Last but not the least I am gonna talk about ISRO. When India wanted to start space research they seek help from NASA but they laughed at India and considered India as 3rd world country. But with the grate effort ISRO have made lot of records in history \First rocket of ISRO was carried on a bicycle\. Though NASA made human land on the moon ISRO discovered the existence of water on Moon for the first time in the world without even landing any drone or moon. FEEL PROUD TO BE A INDIAN..

Jeep made by Polytechnic Student Rohit wants to ride with anand mahindra in his jeep. Want to learn coding Google Grasshopper app can teach you on your mobile. Wanting to do a bachelors degree at a top institute two years after passing higher secondary school is a mental illness: \Satire\ The Indian government has found absolute scientific proof that wanting to do a bachelors degree in science or engineering at a top institute two years after passing higher secondary school is a mental illness that must be treated and that the mental capacity to study science at a top institute begins to deteriorate after you reach a little lower than 20 years of age. There is proof that the utterly horrible curricular standards at state and private universities which let one pursue academic interests albeit only till 25 years of age in case of engineering help with the treatment of the illness. At the same time there is proof that the capacity to study medicine misconceptions in which may result in a life or death situation for someone else doesnt deteriorate till the age of 25 at which age there is a sudden onset of a rare form of mental illness which only medical aspirants suffer from that removes all capacity a student may have for studying medicine. In case of students who realize they want to study medicine after the age of 25 it has been found that they suffer from delusions as they never had the capacity to study medicine in the first pace. The government has concluded that the age discrimination laws in developed countries that protect citizens from age\based discrimination including allowing mature students to study are barbaric laws based on deluded beliefs as the term mature student is an oxymoron and there is no way a mature person ever wants to be a student. The government encourages the use of logical and acceptable words like failure for anyone wanting to expand their knowledge or experiencing changes in interests and intending to enroll in a bachelors degree in science/engineering/medicine at a top institution after reaching 25 years of age. https//i.redd.it/ye64zpl0k1t01.png.

I called up Lenovo presales toll free number and asked when it will be available but they said they dont know yet but will inform me when it is. Even T480 is not available and the only available one which matches my requirements is T470. Now a friend of mine will be travelling from US to India this month and T580 is not only available in US but it is also customizable on their website so that I choose exactly whichever config I want to. My concern is what are the cons of buying this laptop from US For the Thinkpad T470 which is already available in India I am getting 3 years onsite warranty. The US one probably has a global 1 year warranty but I am not exactly sure about it and even thats not an onsite warranty. Should I wait for the launch of these laptops in India or should I buy from US I am a little confused. Thanks. HOW CAN YOU GET BACK YOUR LOVE. LOVE SPELLS TO RETURN BY LOST LOVER AND BRING BACK. India lose contact with GSAT6A satellite within 48 hours. Lets talk about captcha: Hi randians as someone from commerce background I want some expert opinions on the subject of captchas. Do they really work How are they selected Is a computer/AI really incapable of identifying a captcha I never paid much attention to these questions before yesterday while booking a train ticket on IRCTC when I was given [this captcha]https//i.imgur.com/MCo51Zt.jpg. This is a blatant advertisement in form of a captcha and the text to be written is directly related to the advertisement. I booked another ticket a while later and a similar advertisement of another brand was shown. So what my question is that is this captcha as secure as the usual random string of words with alphanumeric characters My guess is no but as I said I wanted some outside opinion of the matter. Also keep in mind that this is IRCTC a governmentrun website which is most probably getting paid by these corporates to place their advertisements in form of such captchas..

The internet offered in Indian languages can add up to 200 million new web users Report. How to start a blog on Whatsapp. Had a fight on the 13 ft Aadhar wall issue: Unpopular opinion Instead of memeing 13ft Aadhar wall comment or making fun of guys who dont understand the difference we should try to educate the masses about it. I sort of had a heated argument with a few uncles about networking servers and security aadhar data storage and how insecure even airgapping is. At that point I realized we the somewhat techsavvy take these knowledge for granted whereas millions do not even have the slightest clue. And then they feel offended if you try to educate them by using jargons. Aside from a few millions of us rest of India doesnt even know how the tech or data storage actually works. I failed to express it in simple words to a nontech savvy person today. Hence they do not care. Unless the masses are taught how it works and why a 13ft wall wont protect their data or even the money in their banks they wont care. The media doesnt show this because the masses dont care. And as long as the media doesnt make a fuss no govt wouldnt do anything to change the present status. I believe this is a good opportunity to educate the general public why privacy should be important to them and how aadhar data breach would affect them. There are a lot of intelligent engineers/scientists on this platform. I am sure we can come up with some easy laymens guide of this whole aadhar system and why it sucks/should be done away with.

[Serious] Software folks of r/india need help deciding between Big Data and Machine Learning: Im an experienced developer who has been exploring Big Data and Machine Learning for the past few months. I find Maths interesting so I have been speaking to teams in my company for a Machine Learning opportunity. Some teams have expressed interest. I havent go to solving Machine Learning competitions yet but will be addressing that drawback within a month.I would say i am fairly decent at a beginner level Now not long back I worked at a Big Data project but more on a DevOps role all that stuff concerning Hadoop HBase Hive Spark was handled by a few experienced folks. I did selfstudy on big data technologies found it interesting and am getting pretty comfortable with the components of a distributed system. So now I am caught between two minds. I am a pretty fast learner but cant make up my mind on whether I should really go for Big Data or Machine learning. I am really fed up on the politics in my company and I am interesting in going onsite. Now the word onsite evokes all kinds of mixed reactions Im not into money and more keen on working with nice passionate colleagueshave worked onsite before and get some worklife balance. Of late a lot of my project involved crazy amounts of politics even though the technologies have been interesting somewhat which is typical in most indian projects. TLDR Between Big Data and Machine Learning which one should I choose I am a bit more than a beginner in both and I would like to make a choice based on onsite opportunities..

I mean xiaomi existed even before this guy joined and not spending on advertising / flash sales was a part of their business model since its inception.

The Myth of the Hacke[R]Proof Voting Machine: [New York Times has a pretty interesting story]https//www.nytimes.com/2018/02/21/magazine/themythofthehackerproofvotingmachine.html on voting machines in US. I thought this is relevant to India as well. Here is an excerpt to peak your interest gt But for as long as experts have warned about security problems voting machine makers and election officials have denied that the machines can be remotely hacked. The reason they say is that the systems are not connected to the internet an assurance the public has largely accepted. This defense was never more loudly expressed than in 2016 when the government disclosed that Russian hackers were probing American voterregistration systems and had breached at least one of them. Concerned that hacking fears could make the public less likely to vote the United States Election Assistance Commission and state election officials rushed to assert that there was no need to worry about the votes because voting machines themselves were isolated from the internet.

BSNL outright denying access to certain websites for no reason.: I couldnt access dailymotion.com so I decided to check if the site is down by going to isitdownrightnow.com BSNL blocked access to this site as well. All other MAIN websites like Facebook YT etc.. are working fine. EDIT Update Ive changed dns to 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 restarted Ubuntu and my modem. Still wont work dailymotion is still not loading but I can access isitdownrightnow.com now but when I enter the address of dailymotion on isitdownrightnow and click on the check button it wont load. When I say wont load I dont mean it takes forever to load. It just shows me the problem loading page connection was reset page as if I was not connected to the internet only when I visit these sites. Is anyone else having this problem even after changing dns on BSNL UPDATE The problem with isitdownrightnow was that I was entering the entire web address on their check box http//www.dailymotion.com/ when I changed it to just dailymotion.com problem is resolved apparently they do not have code to truncate http// on their website.

I didnt know how this happened because she got the vaccination... fast forward to year 2013 and my PCP warned us about oral polio vaccine. OPV is the most potent method against polio but it has a risk factor. It contains live polio virus and in rare cases it can actually cause polio VAPP. IPV is not that potent but there is no risk. So if possible please take IPV instead of OPV. https//academic.oup.com/cid/article/49/8/1287/429938 PS Princy samples were sent abroad to research purposes..

I mean we already know the situation but I was not aware that the person appointed by the govt to look over its cleaning is the guy named Brahma Dutt Tripathi professor of environmental engineering at the Banaras Hindu University and an expert member of the National Ganges River Basin Authority NGRBA. Now the most bizarre part of the whole thing was this guy thinks only problem with the river is the lack of inflow of water. In his opinion River Ganga has ability to clean it self if more water is introduced and yes he repeated it many times its the same thing he said in an interview to TOI recently. On the other hand the environmentalist from Kanpur named Rakesh Jaiswal Founder of Ecofriends is observing and studying this from about more than 30 years says the water was much cleaner before 30 years. The initiative from Modi Govt named Namami Ganga For which they even had an anthem has not cleaned even a drop. Just makes me sad seeing how many people depend on this river..

Shameless self plug Indias first reverse image search tool: Edit Removed link to the Linkedin article and added link to the Github readme page. Longtime lurker and occasional poster here. Wanted to share something really cool that Ive launched after slogging endlessly for more than 6 months. Would love to see you guys tinker with it and give some feedback. We are Quickcompany a Delhi based lean startup that deals with Company / Trademark registration and other boring crap. Consequently we wanted to spice it up by doing something interesting and embarked on this quest for developing a tool for algorithmically identifying potential design infringements. Another reason we decided to do this was to give our bloated copy cat competitors flush with VC money something thats really difficult to clone. There are only two public search engines as far as I know that help with this but unfortunately none of them have the Indian Trademarks. So it was impossible for brands and individuals to compare their designs with the Indian Trademark database and see if some sneaky fucker has copied their design verbatim or made some minor changes to it and registered it as their own. So after months of incessant twiddling we managed to launch [this]https//www.quickcompany.in/trademarks/imagesearch that performs pretty decently with the Indian Trademarks database. It also boasts some improvements over the commercial solutions out there in the market. In case you want to read more about it you can head to this [github link]https//github.com/janghaludu/articlu/blob/master/README.md More improvements to this will come in the next couple of weeks and we are also going to launch another tool very soon for worldwide brands database. Results for that kick some serious ass compared to what we have with the Indian trademarks database. Links to some cool results.

Google has made it compulsory for all phones launched with Oreo to support Treble but phone companies are getting away with launching the phone with Noughat and then quickly updating it to Oreo and thus they dont need to support treble.

These were in the North West and South of India. I used a total of three providers including Jio. My unscientific but consistent observations are that internet speeds are fast as I go away from metropolitan areas. But closer to cities they become very slow at the same time of the day etc. This has happened more often than not so I seriously doubt it to be a coincidence. My guess is that there are more users and buildings in cities but Id also assume there would be accordingly greater number density of microcells and repeater towers to mitigate such effects accordingly.

BHIM app refund for double spend isnt automatic what a shame : I have used the BHIM app multiple times yesterday I was attempting a transaction that failed multiple times. On the last try it went though. When I checked my account I had a double debit. I scanned all my failed transactions and manged to map the failed transaction with the debit that occurred on my bank account. Turns out there is no autoreversal/credit for such transactions you have to raise a complaint and even then its not automated. The bank is sent a request from BHIM and then a process internal to the bank does the job which takes two days. This sucks imagine my case wherein I sent a huge amount.

This is an example why Piracy is so popular in India.: If any of you are fans of professional boxing or were simply drawn into the hype behind Connor Mcgregor vs Floyd Mayweather then you may have heard of VEQTA. This company was supposed to stream the bout on the internet on a pay per view basis or maybe a year on subscription. They didnt really keep up to that. Most people never got to see it since their servers clogged up and crashed spectacularly leaving their app with some abysmal ratings and their twitter with a beautiful plethora of personal attacks. They apparently refunded the money Personally seen no proof to back that. Its months later now and these guys are back. Theyve taken over the rights to stream/telecast the Carabao cup football formerly known as the EFL cup. Now Im a Manchester United fan and two days before the game. I get an email from them telling me that due to unforeseen reason that they cant control they will not be able to telecast the tournament anymore. Since these guys bought the rights earlier on it isnt being telecasted in India on any channel whatsoever. I am stuck now with the only option of either missing the entire tournament or watching a pirated live stream. Just to make it clear they have offered a refund but they havent given me any information as to why they cant stream it anymore just saying that it isnt their fault. Now Im stuck and supposed to believe that. . Interesting. Jio is the second largest user of IPv6 addresses. Huh. Jio is the second ISP using ipv6: [deleted].

My blog technowritings.com is on the list of Top 100 Intellectual Property Law Blogs in the world.. [Original Content] If you are going to buy phones under 10k then check the secondhand market for highend phones of past years too.: 10k is now an optimal price to buy a new phone. You are getting features which were only found in flagships of past years for such a low price. The difference between topend phones and budget phones are merging so much that people have started to question the value they get while buying these expensive highend phones. But there are certain things you dont get at this price. One of it is a good camera. If you want a good camera and a well build phone I suggest looking for the flagship phones of the past years. Samsung Galaxy Note 4 and Note 3 are excellent options. Note 4 is available for around 7k range in the secondhand market. It offers extremely good display and camera. It has a leather back and is a solidly built device. Its launch price was near 60k. It has a finger print sensor as well although it is slow. Its official android version is 6.0 but you can get custom rom and upgrade it to Oreo. LG G3 is also a great option. It is available from around Rs5k and is a great phone. HTC one m9 goes for around 8k and is an awesome good looking phone. There are also good rarer phones like Motorola droid turbo 2 which goes for around 9k range. The only thing you may need to replace in the future is the battery. If there is any scratches in the backside you can just buy a new cover for cheap and replace it. It would be great if the owner had taken care of the phone with a screen protector. You can just remove that cover and put your own cover to make it look new. While buying secondhand phones make sure that you are not getting duped. Buy only after checking all the features of the phone. Dont go alone to some strangers place. If you are not buying from a store then gauge the reputation of the person as well as thieves also sell secondhand goods. Take video/photos of the exchange by bringing a friend with you. Now if you do not find any lucrative deal then buy a new phone by all means.. Online domain authority checker tool Webomania. Blog SEO 5 Easy Steps To Do OnPage SEO For Your Blog.

Startup In India Builds Affordable Homes Out Of Recycled Plastic.Is it good for India: A short while ago I was researching ways to recycle all this staggering amounts of plasticwaste in our community this was the first time I heard about a really interesting Startup Newcomer in India and it totally blew my mind. This Startup wants to solve the waste management and housing crises building earthquake proof Eco Homes out of recycled plastic. Sounds crazy at the first moment but it looks actually like a great solution. I looked into it and I myself find it revolutionary. They are called Gaias Homes Their system is similar to Lego A one Family house could be build in only 5 days and costs so little that everyone can buy one THIS was the WOW Effect for me And it cleans up the environment from all that nasty plastic. I personally LOVE that Idea and I think that concepts like this are or at least should be the future of Construction and Real Estate As far as I know their technology is still open source and they just start business I can smell great opportunities for Entrepreneurs here Here is the Link to an article about them on their own Eco News Platform for everyone interested into it https//gaiashomes.com/buildinghomesrecycledplastic/ What do you guys think about that Thanks.

GST on Solar Power Generating Systems: The GST Council proposed that 18 tax be levied on solar cells and modules while coal was put in the lower tax slab of 5 against its current tax incidence of 11.69. People related to the solar industry were either expecting complete exemption or a place in the 5 tax slab. However it appears that the sharp decrease in solar tariffs and equipment cost have convinced the government that this sector doesnt require any financial incentives. This argument was further strengthened by the renewable energy minister Piyush Goyal who said Solar and wind energy have hit record lows and the industry is now able to stand on its own feet without any support.

There are also a few stores I know of in Hyderabad since Im living here for now. These shops do sell boards along with parts but it would cost me around 3000INR which is just a bit costlier than the ones I found online.

[Original Content] If you want to buy a new smartphone and you are fashion conscious then it would be a good idea to delay your purchase by 2 to 3 months.: We are in the middle of a major trend change in the smartphone industry. This is not about the performance usability or technological advancement but more about aesthetics fashion and design. I had predicted it years ago and I wanted to just make a post about it for those who are going to buy a smartphone now. This post is NOT for tech geeks or performance enthusiasts. All phone companies will launch near Bezelless phones in the next 3 months. It will be there in every budget above Rs 10k. The bezels around the display will become smaller and smaller until the entire front side of the phone is displayonly but that is in the far future. Currently you can expect very thin bezels. [Example photo of mi mix 2]https//cdn2.techadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/reviews/3665755/xiaomimix2review09.jpg Be warned that most companies will create false rendered graphics to show their bezels to be much smaller than the real device like [this ad of the abovementioned mi mix 2 phone]https//cdn.wccftech.com/wpcontent/uploads/2017/11/mimix2.jpg That is a major change in the design of the phones. And it will look more attractive than older phones. The last time such a trend change happened was 5 years ago in 2013 when the display size of the phones started growing to 5inch from the norm of 2.5 to 4 inch. The last to last change happened about 9 years ago when phones started becoming considerably thinner and lighter. So the current [standard design of a phone]http//www.livemint.com/rf/Image621x414/LiveMint/Period2/2017/09/07/Photos/Processed/xiaomikv7C621x414LiveMint.jpg will feel like an outdated design similar to how people felt their thick phones were outdated in 2010. Some bezelless phones have already started coming in the market but more choices will start becoming available in the coming months. Today many people consider phone as a fashion accessory as well and if you are one of them or if you just like newer design then it might be worth it to wait a couple of months before making the purchase.

And Google allows you activity control and allows you not personalize the profile and even lets you edit in granularity as to what info to use to build your profile if you opt out. Hence the argument google does it too is invalid wrong and holds no ground. xiaomi http//openattitude.com/2016/10/26/miuihasbackdoorsmaybe/ The response by xiaomi is actually moot and proves nothing. https//forum.xdadevelopers.com/xiaomimi3/help/dontxiaomiphonessupportencryptiont2979780 For many years xiaomi phones never did encryption. Including the mi3. Permissions Look at the permission wanted by the apps so called standalone apps on play store by oneplus or xiaomi. Look at the gallery app on miui. It refuses to work without contacts and without internet access. And no the response that we do it for grouping does not mean anything and is invalid. It is impossible to de bloat a miui phone without a mi cloud account and there is no option to delete mi cloud account anywhere. Sending emails to mi to delete account does not help and account still exits and no it is logged in from any phone anywhere. Notice I am not talking about unlock of bootloader. Also the usual argument that install custom rom and enjoy is invalid moot and reeks ignorance. Because xiaomi abuses GPL all the time and they do not release the camera or finger print drivers just like the one plus. Also none of them will join project treble. And the so called stock android on one plus is a myth many features like ability to add multiple users were/are absent from the one plus phone.

At least false information now is available for scrutiny.: You hate Whatsapp unkills for spreading unverified news false information religious propaganda and so on. But like the fallacy of [Golden Age]https//np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/6dj7n8/tilthatthegoldenagefallacybelievingthe/ whereby one feels the past was much better we think Whatsapp has exacerbated the spread of malicious information clearly ignoring the benefits of it. Benefits Yes. Dont you see it has exposed all the propaganda which we were previously unaware of We who are arguably more scrupulous than others when any new information crosses our way. We should thank Whatsapp unkills for openly disclosing their twisted world view which used to remain suppressed before the internet and used to get passed down to their kin who used to believe their ever respectable elder. Nothing is new. Cow piss cures diseases talking on mobile during storm can attract lightening drink water only while sitting down cancer can be cured with Vitamin B17 and all such quackery were there before. People have known it for a long time. I admit that Whatsapp causes strong reinforcement of beliefs Since it has been forwarded by so many people it must be true. But it has had positive impact too. Capriciously false news has been completely eliminated where have all the ghosts and aliens gone the stories of whom were told in different variations by people throughout history In absence of proof some self made false knowledge has directly and rightly been eliminated from our culture. All the fraud information is now available for our scrutiny. We can collectively help get them busted. Whatsapp can be a blessing for us. Stay positive. The title is more like a showerthought since I dont have evidence to prove that its correct. Its a theory which needs research. But due to the arguments I have presented it may very well be a truth. . Yesterdays Sentinel3 pass over Northern India.

Reserve Bank of India Hints on Possible Ban on Cryptocurrencies. Why cant we book local unreserved railway tickets through an app or website It is a super easy app to make and implement.: Lets say I want to suddenly go to a small town about 80km away from my current location. The fastest way to reach there is through trains but I have to go the station stand in a queue to book a general unreserved ticket and then board the train. Often times this queue is so long that you have to come much early to get a ticket in time thus making the choice to go by bus more optimal. In one case the train came while I was still standing in the queue for over 15 minutes and when the train started moving I had to run and board the train without a ticket. I felt awful doing that but that was the last train to my destination and if I missed it I would have been in a lot of trouble. I often book reserved tickets for Rs180 one day before the journey to avoid this trouble but it can only be done 24 hours before the journey and only if seats are still available. It is SUPER EASY to make an app for Indian Railway to solve this problem as they dont need to even allocate seats. They just need the following 1. An option to enter the travel details to calculate the ticket cost 2. Have a payment gateway to make money 3. Once payment is completed just show the text user earlier entered along with a timestamp on when it was paid. The ticket is now valid for travel on any trainof course except special long distance train in this route for the next 6 hours. That is it. As simple as that. Just an app to take money without doing anything. They dont even need to connect it to their server or do any complex seat choosing algorithm. Just a simple money grab app. I think this simple app can make the lives of millions of people easier.. mphone 8 Official Trailer. JavaScript.: [deleted].

Combine Harvester vs Modified Scythe Vikalp. Best solution for avoiding crop burning. [TE]: Recently got information about this tool called Vikalp. Which is a modified version of a scythe. The crop is cut with a predominantly slicing motion and the grain cradle lays the crop in neat rows. Using the scythe we could easily manage to harvest between half to one acre of paddy in 6 hours of working thereby saving a considerable amount of time and effort. Also no burning of farmland is required since Vikalp cuts the crop from its base unlike the combine Harvester which does an incomplete job of crop cutting. [Use of Vikalp ]https//youtu.be/bVTFrrMjQ28 It was discussed on the hindi news show NDTV primetime with Ravish Kumar. [Link to video]https//youtu.be/dky88Lf21PY It also had a short interview with the owner/inventor Vivek Chaturvedi of Vikalp tool.

How does iPhone 7 Plus users feel especially those who bought it a couple of months before iPhone 10 was revealed From a common mans perspective iPhone 7 is now 3 generations out of date.: Many people buy iPhone as a status symbol for showing off. I think iPhone 7 would have hit them really bad as it had the worst showoff period of any iPhone. Just a couple of months later it became THREE generations out of date at least in the nomenclature of common men who dont know there was no iPhone 9 and because iPhone X is called iPhone 10 by apple themselves. It would have been better if they just called it X instead but apple seriously wanted people with older iPhone users to feel enough pain to think of upgrading. So how does people who bought expensive iPhone 7 Plus feel Any interesting stories I know a guy who bought it a few months back simply for showing off although he really shouldnt have spent that much money on a phone considering that he had some loans to pay and not a lot of income. Now he regrets it since the perceived value of his new phone fell by so much. He tried to sell it off but didnt seem to get enough money to justify selling.

Dual Camera Smartphones Shipments in India Rose 123 in 1H 2017 But Whats Next In 2018: With the increasing demand of the dual camera smartphones in India the industry is becoming more and more cameracentric now. According to the latest report the shipments of dualcamera smartphones in India rose 123 in the first half of 2017. Only two manufacturers Huawei and LG took a deep focus on Dualcameras as early as 2016. At the beginning of 2017 the Huawei with its Honor 6X variants Lenovo Phab 2 plus and the LG G6 and V20 made their mark on the India smartphone market. Q2 2017 saw Micromax ZTE OnePlus and Gionee among others shipping Dualcamera smartphones to the India market. Clearly there has been a shift in the smartphone vendor marketing narrative from pixel quality to Dualcameras. Looking forward into the future it is interesting to see how Google with its Google Pixel 2 has avoided the Dualcamera craze and focused on its single camera. The approach adopted by Oppo with its optical zoom periscope lens could also be the next big step in pushing the envelope forward..

The highest speed any telecom in India provided till date is only 16Mbps which is even possible on 3G network. What is the need for 4G then This needed some debunking.: I know this could have been replied to in the original thread. Wireless communication systems are multiplexed. The theoretical 300 Mbps speed in 4G is the cumulative speed provided to all mobile phones connect to that particular tower. The 21.1 Mbps speed for HSPA 3.5G is also the same thing. Cumulative speed to all people connected to that tower. Even what I have just said is an over simplification. These are theoretical speeds that are only attained if the best modulation scheme is being used. For noiseless channels Theoretical Bitrate Symbols per second Bits per symbol Sampling frequency Bits per symbol 2 Bandwidth log2L. L is number of symbols in a modulation. Now if you use a modulation scheme in which each symbol represents more bits you get a higher data rate. What are digital modulation schemes Google BPSK QPSK 8QAM 16QAM and 64QAM. But you cant do this arbitrarily. Channels are never noiseless. ShannonHartley theorem dictates every every transmission. https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ShannonHartleytheorem gt In information theory the ShannonHartley theorem tells the maximum rate at which information can be transmitted over a communications channel of a specified bandwidth in the presence of noise. gt The ShannonHartley theorem states the channel capacity C meaning the theoretical tightest upper bound on the information rate of data that can be communicated at an arbitrarily low error rate using an average received signal power S through an analog communication channel subject to additive white Gaussian noise of power N gt C B log21 S/N So if you keep on transferring at a rate higher than the channel capacity there errors will incur in your transmission. So you try to increase gain of the antenna amplifier to mask the channels noise. But then even at amplifiers end you cant just arbitrarily keep on increasing gain. Amplifier will add noise of its own and then there are SAR limits that need to be worried about. https//www.fcc.gov/general/specificabsorptionratesarcellulartelephones To oversimplify the modulation scheme that is used by your mobile phone is typically decided by how far you are from the tower i.e. the signal strength. Basically if I am the only guy connect to a 4G tower and I am very far from the tower Im not going to get 300 Mbps. Ill have to be the only guy sitting right next to the tower to get that kind of speed. Next if there are a lot of people connected to the same tower and everyone is downloading or watching something obviously you will not get good speed. I hope this answers the question gt The highest speed any telecom in India provided till date is only 16 Mbps which is even possible on 3G network. What is the need for 4G then tldr 300 Mbps is cumulative speed from one tower to everyone. Even 7.2 Mbps in HSDPA is the same. This cumulative speed is multiplexed/shared between everyone. There are a lot of people in India to clog up mobile networks. And spectrum is scarce. I think desi towers are configured by companies to only provided 4050 mbps cumulative or so. Again depends on how much spectrum the company is having and how frequency is being reused via cells http//www.raymaps.com/index.php/softfrequencyreuse/. Move to villages if you want better 4G speeds. There are just too many people with smartphones in cities. To add India actually needs a wired Internet revolution. Expecting ultimate speeds on mobile for a country with a population like ours is not really feasible as of now. Edit In India not everyone had 3G. But everyone has 4G now. Thats why we need 4G..

[AskIndia]Is it illegal to ask for aadhaar number in my app: Hello fellow /r/indians I am making a social networking app with some other features as my pet project.

This will not be verified via biometrics rather you just put the number in. If someone else claims the same aadhaar both accounts go in lockdown till any one of them submits a scan of their aadhaar. This seems good enough for me but I was wondering about the legality of it. I came across [this]http//www.moneylife.in/article/storingaadhaarnumberpunishableundertheaadhaaract/50387.html article. It mentions this is illegal but all the acts and regulations discussed are for entities that are actually using the whole aadhaar ecosystem like verifying fetching and matching biometrics etc. Another point saving the aadhaar number in databases is illegalagain if the rules apply to me or not Im not sure but what if I store the number on the users phones memory only. is that fine Sorry for troubling you all but I cannot find an answer to this and would really appreciate some help.

It was also for a specific period. Right now general tariff plans give 1gb per day which tbh imo is quite low as with 4g speeds the amount of data consumed is far more. I remember when we switched to only Jio and no broadband at home 1 gb seemed so less that I had to use 2 sum cards. Also the days when I had to download episodes from the torrents that were 1 gb each. So whats the reason India is still lacking behind in internet How can this be solved.

Am not sure if he even cared about those extra measurements like Spherical/Cylindrical or any kind of axis. He would prepare those specs within hours while i waited in the shop. Yesterday i decided to go for online shopping and via filling prescriptions there were many unknown columns i asked the guy for vanilla 2 and he obliged. Today i was browsing through my emails and saw some eye examination report from Lasik Test i had taken in the past and voila it had all the detailed specifications.

A cool review on MICROMAX CANVAS JUICE 2 . ONE OF THE COOLEST PHONE: [deleted]. Feedback on my new website.. Coding.. Jio is spamming my alternative contact number with automated calls and messages Help: I have a Jio number as my secondary SIM like practically the rest of the country. Over time I realized there is no way I am going to give up my primary number and I dont care about getting 1 GB every day as my primary provider airtel has given me around 60 GB for the next 6 months which is more than enough for my needs. I prefer to watch videos and all on my laptop and thats usually hooked to wifi wherever I end up travelling to. So I didnt recharge for Jio when my Dhan Dhana Dan recharge started ending in September. Thats when daily 34 automated calls started on my Airtel number Each time it would be a different Jio number not sure if I can share those numbers here so adding to blacklist did nothing. The voice would just start rambling off that I should recharge immediately to continue enjoying Jio services. And every few hours my phone would buzz with a message from Jio Care saying they have graciously given me some free calls and data for the next 7 days and that I should recharge soon The calls became so annoying that I ultimately had to switch off my phone for the weekend Btw my primary sim has DND activated and there should be a fair limit to how much they can bother me on my alternate contact number even if they dont have the decency to avoid push notifications over their own SIM and network. Is there anyway I can report them to the regulator or are they too hand in glove with Reliance anyway. ALIEN born in Patna Bihar: [deleted].

So can I link the Jiofi to a router then connect the dvr Which is the cheapest router that would work My options so far [TP link 3020]https//www.amazon.in/TPLinkTLMR3020PocketWirelessRouter/dp/B00634PLTW/. I think this works with a normal dongle but since the Jio is on offer for now Id prefer it if possible. [Tenda 301]https//www.amazon.in/TendaN301WirelessN300SetupRouter/dp/B00D3GO8R4/. This is the cheapest router with bridge mode would be perfect if this is enough. Would they work or is there any other way Am I missing anything obvious Any help is appreciated. Thanks. Huawei Honor 9i vs Xiaomi MI A1 Full Specifications Comparison. Jios 4G Speed Is Still Lags Behind Airtel Vodafone and Idea : Despite the significant improvement in Jios 4G speed it is still lagging behind Airtel Vodafone and Idea According to the latest Opensignal report Jios average 4G/LTE download speed rose to 5.81 Mbps a near 50 increase in last 6 months whereas Airtels fell to 9.15 Mbps. But Jio redeems itself when it comes to sheer 4G availability and reach. Jios network is by far the most easily accessible with users able to connect to it 95.59 of the time followed by Idea Vodafone and Airtels 4G network availability. So what could be the reason behind the increase in Jios 4G speed and the decrease in all other top mobile operators. REAL TIME WEATHER INFORMATION KSNDMC Karnataka.

Try any method possible on the internet This is not same unlocking bootloader or rooting the device. 1.1 One of the system apps is Xiaomi services framework. 1.2 A google search on xiaomi services framework backdoor will let you know what this does and what it can POTENTIALLY DO. Specifically https//thelibreguy.wordpress.com/2016/10/16/xiaomitrackersandbackdoorsupdate/ 1.2 It is not possible to delete a mi cloud account. Try deleting your mi cloud see i.mi or write emails to xiaomi. What 1.1 and 1.2 mean together You cannot prevent malware running in your phone. Yes google might do it too. But Sony or Panasonic or Samsung may not. Question is who is xiaomi selling your data to or what do they want to achieve by having the capability to basically explode your device at their will 2 . OpenSource Abuse 2.1 A google search on xiaomi GPL licence will reveal that they constantly abuse it. 2.2 Nobody in China has taken them to court which means Chinese govt heavily favors them. What 2.1 and 2.2 mean together If you care about opensource stop using MiUi phones. 3 So called custom ROM support. They do not on time or at all release the camera or fingerprint drivers which means you cannot achieve the same quality on any custom ROM. 4 Encryption A google search on Mi3 encryption will let you know that for years the phones running MiUi could not be encrypted upon Combine this with the fact that cheetah mobile comes pre installed as system app on MiUi phones. Where was your data being send to for all those years tldr Care about open source/encryption/Codeabuse Stop phone running MiUi. .

WhatsApp Business Messaging Service Testing Begins in India BookMyShow a Client ...: Whatsapp latest update in india Online movie ticketing service BookMyShow is among the first batch of businesses to sign up for WhatsApp Indias favourite messaging app with over 200 million active users as it looks to turn many of the traditional texts digital. The move the fruition of which is likely to take a few months would help BookMyShow and other companies build a more interactive relationship with their customers. The Facebookowned instant messaging client announced last year that it intended to find ways to work with businesses in the coming months. Now that the first signs of its plans have surfaced it will serve as a deja vu moment for telecom operators in India that have already seen WhatsApp and Facebook lure their subscribers from traditional texting habits. Much of India especially those with smartphones now uses WhatsApp and other instant messaging clients to send messages. Indians sent over 1.4 billion messages through WhatsApp last year. Indian telecom operators do not disclose how many texts are exchanged on their networks. Going by the industry trend the volume of SMS exchange is dropping. It was already dropping rapidly in 2014 according to a TRAI report. But traditional texts arent over yet nor should they be more on this shortly. Ordering any item online whether its your lunch a new phone or a fan sets wheels in motion for an army of texts to be delivered to you phone. More often than not it goes like this acknowledgement confirmation status details of the personnel handling the delivery delivery feedback and in coming days offers. Those texts could soon move to WhatsApp. Things are still at early stage so we dont know if the participating companies will stop sending text messages altogether at least for users who opt for it but it seems like a possibility. BookMyShow is at present testing its WhatsApp Business profile. WhatsApp is unlikely to leave any stones unturned. The service which is still free to consumers has been scrambling for ways to find a business model. It continues to offer its service without ads and charging business customers for the platform seems like an avenue WhatsApp wouldnt want to underplay. Especially when it knows that another company is prepping for it. Paytm Indias largest mobile wallet app plans to launch a messaging feature for businesses as well. The company is expected to roll out the feature this year. Regardless of the ambitions the companies have SMSes will continue to remain in existence even for Paytm and WhatsApp savvy users.

However you will have to wait at least a week before the Jio Phone you booked reaches you as the company will not start deliveries till September. Reliance Jio reportedly aims to sell as many as 100 million units of the phone in the first year and roughly the same number the next year. However the Jio servers crashed and users were unable to book Jio Phone from MyJio app and the Jio.com website when Jio started taking the preorders. If you have questions about the Jio Phone booking process price features etc. just scroll down for all the answers. How do I book Jio Phone To book JioPhone you have three options the Jio.com website the MyJio app and authorised offline Jio retailers. All you need to do make the Jio Phone booking is to give your phone number and the pincode delivery address and pay a sum of Rs. 500. Once the booking has been made you will receive a voucher number that you can refer to while picking up the handset. When the JioPhone you booked is up for delivery you will receive an SMS mentioning the store from which it can be picked up. Even the units booked online will have to be picked up offline. Can I book the Jio Phone for a friend Yes you can book multiple JioPhone units for your friends and family. All you need is their respective phone numbers and delivery pincodes. You will have to make a Rs. 500 payment for each unit you preorder at the time of booking itself. When do I make the full payment The refundable security amount for Jio Phone is Rs. 1500 of which Rs. 500 is as mentioned above paid at the time of booking. The remaining Rs. 1000 has to be paid when you pick up the handset from the offline store. How many units can I book On the MyJio app and Jio.com website there seems to be no cap on how many units of the handset can be booked we went up to 30 units. Multiple units can be booked against the same number and pincode as well and you just need to make the Rs. 500 partial deposit per unit at the time of booking. Can I transfer my booking to someone else After ordering the Jio 4G phone if you decide against buying it you can transfer the booking to someone else using the Transfer option in the MyJio app under Manage Bookings. After entering your number and OTP you will see an overview of your JioPhone bookings with information such as orders placed and number of units for each order. Now tap on the Transfer button above the JioPhone banner and the screen will switch to a new interface with the option to reassign your booking to someone else. All you will have to do is to provide the new users phone number the new delivery pincode and number of units to be transferred in case you booked more than one. The recipient will instantaneously receive a SMS from Jio mentioning their new booking. JioPhone bookings can be transferred to others using Manage Booking in MyJio app When will my Jio Phone unit be delivered JioPhone delivery schedule is not yet known though the company does say it will start deliveries in September. Each user will receive the delivery schedule and details of the offline store their unit can be picked up from via SMS. Reliance Jio aims to deliver 5 million 50 lakh units of the handset per week. How much data will I get with the phone The phone comes with two primary recharge packs priced at Rs. 153 and Rs. 309. The Rs. 153 JioPhone pack provides 500MB data at 4G speeds and the speed goes down to 128kbps after the highspeed data cap is exhausted. You will also get 300 free SMSs access to compatible Jio apps such as JioTV JioCinema JioXpressNews and JioMusic. Voice calls are free on the Jio network as well. With the Rs. 309 Jio Phone recharge pack you will get the same benefits as the Rs. 153 pack but 1GB of data per day. If you plan to use the Jio PhoneTV Cable called the JioMediaCable that lets you mirror content playing on the phone directly on the big screen then you must buy the Rs. 309 recharge pack. This recharge pack will become available for purchase only when the cable hits the market. There are also two sachet packs of Rs. 24 and Rs. 54 with validities of 2 days and 7 days respectively. Is the Jio PhoneTV Cable free Where and when can I buy it The JioMediaCable will not be available free though it is not yet clear how much it will cost. Similarly there is no clarity at the moment regarding its launch date. However it is confirmed that the accessory will be available to purchase both online and offline for JioPhone buyers. Which apps will work on Jio Phone Jio says apart from its own apps users will get popular instant messaging and social networking apps on the handset. However WhatsApp inarguably the most popular messaging app in India is not present on the KAI OSbased platform at the moment though it may be added later on. We did catch a glimpse of Facebook on the phone at the launch event along with PM Narendra Modis Mann Ki Baat app. With a VGA camera in front you can expect video calling apps JioVideoCall at least to work on the handset too. Other Jio apps that will be preloaded on the phone are JioShare JioGames and a Web browser. If we are talking about the phones software the devices HelloJio voice recognition system that supports 22 Indian languages needs to be mentioned as well. According to the demo at the launch event the voice recognition system will allow users to control certain functions on the phone by saying commands aloud in their vernacular languages. The website says it can make calls send SMSs launch the browser and camera apps and open JioTV JioCinema JioMusic etc. Which languages are supported on the Jio Phone The JioPhone supports 22 Indian languages that should cover most of the regional languages in the country. The full list of languages supported by the JioPhone in alphabetical order is Assamese Bengali Bodo Dogri Gujarati Hindi Kannada Kashmiri Konkani Maithili Malayalam Manipuri Marathi Nepali Oriya Punjabi Sanskrit Santhali Sindhi Tamil Telugu and Urdu. What are the key Jio Phone features and specifications Jio Phone has a 2.4inch display with 320x240 pixel resolution dualcore 1.2GHz Spreadtrum SPRD 9820A/QC9805 processor 512MB RAM 4GB internal with expansion support up to 128GB 2megapixel rear camera VGA front camera 2000mAh battery with talk time of 12 hours NFC for digital payments software support to be added later Bluetooth 4.1 4G VoLTE WiFi and USB 2.0 support. You will get a flashlight alphanumeric keypad with 4way navigation button in the middle FM radio and headphone jack on the phone. It will also have Microsoft Exchange email support and allow you to import contacts synced with your Google account. The company says some of these features will be released later via software updates.

Its becoming hard/Impossible to hire good engineers in India.: A bit of background information I have been working as a developer for around 12 years now. Have worked in 8 developed countries. Various titles like Architect Lead Engineer and Project Manager have been given to me. I think of myself as a developer and Im hands on. Since Im senior I help out my company for recruitment. I typically conduct 14 Skype interviews a day. Over the past couple of years getting good developers has become SO DIFFICULT. Developers lie on their CV Cannot explain what they did in a project which is mentioned on their CV. Poor communication skills. Many/most fail drug tests a requirement for many clients in the US we do sensitive projects Poor multilanguage polyglot skills. I am a Java guy type response. For singleskilled guys lack of depth in that particular skill. Even super easy frameworks like Ruby on Rails Lying even in interviews. ie making up shit when you dont know the answer No motivation other than salary. No thirst for knowledge no idea about their own career path No good answer to the question Where do you see yourself 5 years from now No real hobbies. DSLR photos with bokeh are not a hobby. Seeing TV series is not a hobby. Drinking is not a hobby. Only desire is to be onsite I have worked and lived in 8 different countries without ever asking or requesting the onsite. Many developers ask me about on site when I ask them if they have any questions during interview process If your desire is to see the US get a tourist visa. If you want to travel be a digital nomad freelance Airbnb location of your choice is much better than asking a company for onsite I am struggling to hire Ruby on Rails guys given the problems I stated . God save me if I have to hire Erlang or Lisp developers I can understand why there are job losses. Most people are just not upto it be it communication or technical skills. Oh and dont get me started on ethics I could write a novel on how bad we are ethically. The IT industry is to India what oil is to Saudi Arabia. Its a huge revenue generator. I think because of the low quality of people coming in we are doomed. PS. Dont make the excuse my college was shit so Im not a programmer. All colleges in India are shit and being a programmer has nothing to do with college. My college is a bloody Dgrade college. The best programmer in my company is a male opera singer with a baritone. Its about being self motivated and having a thirst for knowledge. Which is lacking unfortunately. If you think you are different from what I have stated. PLEASE DM Me. I am desparately looking for good developers. Edit added newlines . India blocks Wayback Machine Internet Archive Here are 8 alternatives to it..

Khichri Apps ISRO made solar calculator clueless about MNRE SPIN: India is looking towards a robust solar energy programme that will bolster the energy security of the nation. From a mere 57260 MW at present India wants to increase its renewable energy capacity to 175000 MW in 5 years time. A steep unrealistic target as has been critiqued by many considering the progress of the renewable energy programmes in India that span nearly three decades. The most poorly performing sector in Indias renewable discourse is rooftop solar. With little participation from the grass roots individuals and private entities the rooftop solar like all other solar programmes will remain top driven. So far 3044 MW solar rooftop systems have been sanctioned all over India whereas an aggregate of only 506 MW have been installed in residential industrial commercial and institutional sectors including government undertakings. The target however is 40000 MW. The persistent inability of the governmental agencies in convincing rooftop owners coupled with poor outreach and closing of the last loop has made solar unattractive for common users. Even the ministries seem all confused when it comes to delivering a userfriendly roadmap. The solar calculator app mishmash A case in point is an app developed this June by the The Indian Space Research Organization ISRO being proudly presented to all members of parliament in a recently concluded science exhibition 28 July 11 August at the Parliament Annexe. The mobile app Solar Calculator see picture has been made to help the user determine the solar potential of a location in case he wants to generate solar energy at that lat/long. The app is intended to provide quick in situ analysis of the solar energy generation capacities of a particular location. It is based on satellite information and is a precise method of data generation in terms of solar insolation. The app then presents a table which allows one to check the periodical monthly / yearly solar potential in kWh/m2 or mJ/m2 for the location. The app also measures temperature extremes elevation angles of locations and day lengths over the year FE Online 2017. ISRO claims that the solar potential is calculated from data sourced from ISROs satellites such as from the INSAT 3D and Kalpana1. A report for a particular location is exported and is also saved in the form of a PDF file. Available for the Android OS the app can display data in the form of a table map or graph ISRO 2017. On the other hand it is interesting to note that the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy MNRE Government of India already has in place an online statewise evaluation system to help users understand the potential that a solar energy unit has. Launched in January 2017 SPIN as it is acronymed Solar Photovoltaic Installation forms part of the process of solar rooftop system installations. Once fed details about the area that a user has at his disposal and to which state he belongs the SPIN calculates the cost payback period and more. An Installation Interest Form is also provided to further help the user. Alternatively the users could scan the QR code appearing on their phone and access a link within the app. When the GnY reporter posed the question to both ISROs as well as MNREs senior officials about whether they were aware of each others work both drew a blank. Other solar calculators world over Google has a similar app for calculating solar potential called Project Sunroof. The app utilizes the high resolution mapping used by Google Earth to calculate the solar energy potential of the location. The app has the potential to connect domestic users with local suppliers of solar equipment and power thus tapping into the individual agency of the domestic user. Similarly in Dubai the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority DEWA formed out of a merger between Dubai Electricity Company and the Dubai Water Department has developed a web application called the Shams Dubai Calculator for similar purposes. The difference is in the fact that the app allows users to undertake the production of solar energy under the Shams Dubai Initiative. Under the Shams Dubai Initiative rooftop electricity is generated in a grid out of which excess power is discharged to DEWAs grid. The programme has reportedly led to more than 200 houses being connected to the grid in Dubai. Indias solar calculators with low last mile connectivity Although the mobile Solar Calculator app developed by ISRO is detailed in terms of GIS data SPINs proximity to the MNREs infrastructure currently provides SPIN some benefits. For example SPIN asks for location specific area information from the user instead of analyzing it only in terms of satellite GIS data in a Solar Calculator. SPIN thus is able to arrive at a tentative cost estimate of the solar power installation that is combined with an online registration process as described earlier. Solar Calculator however is limited to making an estimate of the total solar power potential for a location in kWh/m2 without any estimate of the costs involved. This makes SPIN more suitable for medium to small scale installations and more relevant for the domestic consumer for whom a major concern is cost and a wellmanaged budgetary analysis of the prospects of installing solar power. What is surprising therefore is why the two apps could not be strengthened and promoted under a single platform Would it not have been a better idea to integrate ISROs accuracy parameters into the already functioning SPIN to give a point based analysis of solar power potential. Also considering that ISRO is a later entrant in the field and having considerable resources at its disposal could not have mandated a better and more enduser friendly deliverable much in the lines of Project Sunroof. The problem is the policy centric approach of ISRO and MNRE. As is the fall out with most policy driven development the last mile closure and a surefooted user intervention becomes the last priority. The fact that no solar installation provider list exists in SPIN talks of the poor privateserviceprovider integration of MNRE. The apps in question should have had three basic information fields what is the potential and the tentative cost at level one who can provide the service at level two integrated with the banks willing to provide loans for the endeavour at level three. That would ensure the last mile connectivity. If India indeed is serious about fulfilling its renewable targets it should look at the individual segment a little more closely rather than depending solely on internally and externally funded projects and solar parks. .

Unexpected response at a technical conference: So I was recently at a conference in Bangalore. The conference I am talking about is good conference and is mainly associated with aerodynamic research studies. Me and a junior of mine submitted a paper to the conference and were happy that it got accepted. The conference was today and it went horrible. I accept that the presentation was not upto the mark but the response of the audience and the judges was very unexpected. These people are at very respectable positions in different government agencies. And they taunted us. They laughed at us. It was very humliating to say the least. They did not have a background of car aerodynamics and werent being able to understand what we were telling them. Obviously they cross questioned which we tried to explain. But they just didnt want to listen. Towards the end there were even remarks like not upto the mark and you are mechanical engineers should stay in mechanical only. And on top of that many of them were laughing at our faces while we tried to explain the project. I want to pursue a masters in Aerospace and today was a big blow to my confidence.

ISRO gearing up for second prototype test of RLVTD: THIRUVANANTHAPURAM A little over a year since the successful flight test of the first prototype of the futuristic Reusable Launch Vehicle Technology Demonstrator RLVTD ISRO is gearing up for a second go. Only this time the prototype will land on land instead of water. Work is progressing at the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre VSSC here on the second RLVTD. A senior officer associated with the project said the RLVTD will almost be a ditto version of the first scaleddown RLVTD with the only exception being it will have landing gear. ISRO sources said it may take another year for the model to be ready. They said the present plan is to launch the RLVTD from Sriharikota and land it on an undisclosed Air Force airfield in the eastern sector. This is yet to be finalised though they said. The unmanned RLVTD comprises a space shuttlelike component fitted atop a booster rocket. The first RLVTD weighing 1.5 tonnes was successfully launched from Sriharikota on May 23 last year and splashed down in the Bay of Bengal from a height of 64.8 km. While VSSC is primarily responsible for building the RLVTD the navigational equipment are being provided by the ISRO Inertial Systems Unit in Thiruvananthapuram and ISROs Satellite Applications Centre Ahmedabad. Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd is responsible for the landing gear. In fact ISRO plans a series of TDs before attempting to build a fullyfledged vehicle that can be reused for launching satellites. A subsequent TD will possibly involve a slightly larger vehicle which will place a nanosatellite in the orbit..

The support person told me that he gave the details to mobile team and they will contact me via phone in few hours. Lets see how that goes. Update Yesterday They didnt call. I called them. Support person told me to uninstall and logout the the app from old phone and try it fresh in new phone. Tried it and it still says invalid pin. Evening after multiple chat and phone calls finally a humble support person gave me a pin to get inside the app and told me that only after running full diagnostics with the app we will move forward to next step. Pin worked. I ran all test. That app basically seems to check all the sensors of the device and uploads the report to amazon. But unfortunately I cant run SIM test since I dont have nano sim. I deceived to run it next day with friends SIM. Today Morning I read in r/oneplus that its confirmed its indeed 180 mounted display causing this effect. After reading a lot I decided not to return my device hoping XDA or OP will come with some workaround in future. Coz even if I get a replacement there is no guaranty that the new device will not suffer from same problem since all devices displays are 180 mounted. And it more like a manufacture decision to mount the display that way rather than a defect. Except jelly issue the device is perfect. TLDR Called the support. After multiple calls received a pin to enter the app. Ran all test except SIM since I dont have nano sim. Next day decided not to return since all display are built that way and no guaranty that the new device will not suffer the same.. QUIZ Who was Mahalanobis anyway.

[PSA] Kaspersky AntiVirus amp Internet Security is available on Amazon India for upto 3 years license which is cheaper Rs. 626 for AntiVirus and Rs. 1000 for Internet Security. 1 PC 3 Years: Needless to say you dont need a paid av for optimal protection but if you want to increase your safety then consider buying Kaspersky offline. Why because its the cheapest and the best top awards by avtest.org and av comparatives. I was using Avast free with Malwarebytes anti malware Hitman Pro as second opinion for years still I was infected with some viruses from pen drive. My neighbor uncle visited my home with his infected drive for some documents unfortunately I was at college. When I came back I saw avast detected some viruses. Ran Malwarebytes to cleanup it caught some more then I ran avast full scan and malwarebytes full scan endlessly because Im a security freak I was more afraid because I do all of my banking work online. Well I dont use pc anymore most of the time but I need it sometimes. also avasts new update of their av slowed down my pc. Recently needed my pendrive and pc for some printing I had to plug in my pendrive outside because I have no printer and got infected again.. whats scary was avast is not scanning removable media when connected. finally decided to try Kaspersky. It scanned my pc and found another malware. Yes I could have reformatted my pc and roll back any damages but I had some documents and media which I dont have any backup elsewhere. I have a old pc its not worth formatting and installing windows update again and again. Installed Kaspersky Internet Security trial it didnt slowed down my aged Pentium Dual Core with 3 GB ram and 500GB HDD. There is some good features such as safe money which creates safe process isolated from system for online banking and transaction. If you want you can go with their AV which is good enough but you wont get firewall safe money feature. Rs. 626 for 3 years is pretty cheap and manageable. Now Im sharing some tips if you dont wanna upgrade to a paid av. Use Avast free as main av and Malwarebytes Hitman Pro as second opinion to scan on demand. Regularly update them and perform a scan once a month or week. You can use Microsoft Security Essentials Windows Defender but they dont have a online scanning module which scans for infected urls. Leave Windows User Account ControlUAC to default settings dont turn it off. It notifies when a program is trying to get installed or making changes to your pc. It blocks malware programs and needs input from you whether you want that program to install or not. Its not foolproof and can be bypassed by many programs thats why you need an antivirus. Keep two pendrives one for storing media and one for using at friends pc or cyber cafe. Always connect that second pendrive to your mobile after using at a cyber cafe. Since androids dont get infected by windows virus you can check if any unnecessary programs on the drive and delete it from there. Consider using Linux Ubuntu is very user friendly and can be installed alongside with windows. I dont use it mainly because my pc is a family pc and still LibreOffice is far behind than Microsoft Office. Its fine if your workplace uses LibreOffice it has some compatibility issue with MS office. So use Ubuntu or any linux to perform any online tasks and use Windows for document editing gaming. Lastly keep your Windows pc updated with all latest versions of programs browsers and security patches. Use Chrome or Firefox. Hope this post helps you to achieve a much secured digital life.

Indias sluggish response to cyberattack that infected 3.2 million cards exposes its vulnerabilities [[Scroll]https//scroll.in/article/839892/indiahasquietlyburiedthecyberattackthatinfected32milliondebitcardsandremainsatrisk] Ed Note Although the article touches upon some important points there are glaring unsubstantiated explanations of the attack provided in the article. It says that the breach proliferated by infecting the debit cards themselves which further infected other ATMs and so on. This is quite hard to believe unless it is backed by evidence. Breaking of the chip based cards security is unlikely given current sceanrio otherwise wed be looking at a major India wide recall of most debit/credit cards in circulation not just few banks. If the infection was through the mag stripe it would still require the original ATMs to have capability to write to the mag stripes and also the mag stripes would need to hold much more than a few bytes of data that they have the capacity for to be able to propagate the infection further.

[Britney Spears Instagram was used by Russian hackers as control servers]https//arstechnica.com/security/2017/06/russianhackersturntobritneyspearsforhelpconcealingespionagemalware/ Security researchers sat ESET found out two important things past week. First was a more known method of a firefox extension masquerading as a security feature actually spreading malware capable of giving complete control of the computer to attackers. The second finding was more amusing. Instead of using a traditional control server somewhere on the TOR network or some hidden IP in Russia they were hiding the commands in the comments on Britney Spears Instagram posts. The comments were made to look like benign but the extension took out specific characters based on a regex and joined them together to form the commands to do the attackers bidding.

If they truly are better insulators no reason to have them reintroduced as building materials. Asking just out of curiosity no other motive..

Climate change is real and acknowledging it and doing something about it would surely amount to something especially as we Indians contribute to 15 of world population. I found this comment by u/Soktee on r/science which lists a few things we can do. Do add to it if you feel anything major or more relevant to India has been missed out I have been reading research for a while and compiling a simple bullet list. If anyone spots a mistake or would like to add something let me know. FOOD eat less meat dairy and other animal products none is the best eat less industrially produced food less processed food less packaged foods for example bottled water uses energy to be packaged produces waste needs energy to be refrigerated so drink tap water eat proper portion sizes ENERGY dont be afraid of nuclear power plants buy solar panels use efficient lightbulbs turn the lights off when youre not in the room insulate your home dont warm or cool the rooms more than necessary if at all possible forgo living in a singlefamily house in favor of apartmentstyle housing. That way more people get to live on less land sharing of walls is more energy efficient commutes are shorter etc. criticize and complain about large buildings like malls that warm up or cool down the air too much drive less cycle and walk as much as possible WASTE buy recyclable items qtips with paper stick instead of plastic bamboo toothbrushes etc. recycle dont buy more than you need but for items that you are certain you will use and can last for a while buy in bulk to avoid extra packaging avoid items with too much packaging avoid singleuse items dont use disposable cutlery disposable wipes if you are menstruating use menstrual cups instead of pads or tampons etc. contact manufacturers and complain of excess packaging WATER dont flush the toilet when not necessary dont throw anything in the toilet except bodily fluids and solids and toilet paper no cotton pads no qtips no floss no tampons no cigarette butts no paper towels... turn the water off while you are lathering brushing your teeth etc. cut down on showers and baths dont water your lawns try to plant plants that can take drought ACTIVISM Encourage others to adopt sustainable lifestyle Donate money to environmental charities Be careful who you vote for pressure your representatives and politicans Look into buying carbon emission offset this is the only point on this list that I havent researched yet so Im not sure I think out of those eating meat flying and driving are the worst offenders but since there is 7 billion of us everything matters.

According to my calculations Tamil Nadus wind energy productions should provide for 30M people. If this isnt the case then why not: According to Wikipedia [Tamil Nadus wind power capacity is around 29 of Indias total.[when] The Government of Tamil Nadu realized the importance and need for renewable energy and set up a separate Agency as registered society called the Tamil Nadu Energy Development Agency TEDA as early as 1985. Now[when] Tamil Nadu has become a leader in Wind Power in India. In Muppandal windfarm the total capacity is 1500 MW the largest wind power plant in India. The total wind installed capacity in Tamil Nadu is 7633 MW.[15] During the fiscal year 201415 the electricity generation is 9.521 GWh with about a 15 capacity utilization factor.]https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WindpowerinIndiaTamilNadu According to my calculations [and this website]https//www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.phpid427ampt3 the average American consumes 1455 W of power 24 hours a day and 365 days a year and there are 320M Americans. If you do the math on the 4.08 Trillion killowatt hours consumed by Americans you too will arrive at my figures. Anyways I believe that the average Indian would consume 1/4 what the average American consumes lets say 375 W. However lets allow 250 W of power consumption to come from wind and the other 125 W to come from conventional means. Then using my math based on the Wikipedia article there is enough power for 30M Indians in Tamil Nadu. Is this the case Also when I was a kid in the 80s90s we had electricity only 18 hours or so a day. Many times wed have no electricity all day.

This video should be enough to get youtube banned in India given the atmosphere in country now a days.: [Heres]https//www.youtube.com/watchvvS8Fzy3tGBo Vox recommending people to eat beef instead of chicken. Because for equivalent meat of one cow you have to kill 200 chickens. And why kill 200 animals when you can kill one because less animal suffering this way. But the hypocrisy of Vox strikes me when I realise that a few days ago they were doing a series on climate change and environment. And it has been found that cows are much more harmful for environment than chicks because cows release methane gas in their farts which is 22 times more harmful to environment than carbon dioxide. And even Leonardo Di Caprio suggested people to eat only chicken instead of beef in his documentary Before the flood. So Vox here is not only being offensive to kulcha warriors here in India but to climate change activists also at the same time. Which is a rare thing when kulcha warriors and scientists agree on something. Though both might have their different reasons..

[TE] Zomatos iffy apology letter: I just got a shitty email from Zomato today. It was a wonderful example of the we are sorry if you are offended apology letter.

Somebody gonna get fired real bad... hopefully starting with the CTO. It helps that a large chunk of their business is in the EU which takes shit like this seriously. gt Hello gt We are writing to inform you about a recent security incidence that involves your Zomato account information. While we have taken appropriate measures to limit the impact this has for you we recommend that you please go through the below details to understand what happened and how it affects you. gt In summary You are advised to change your password gt What happened gt On the 17th of May our team discovered an unauthorized access to a part of our infrastructure that led to exposing the Names and Email addresses of close to 17 million users as well as hashed passwords for some of these users from our database. We have since patched the vulnerability that resulted in this breach. We also got in contact with the person who accessed this information. The exposed data has not been made public. gt How this impacts you gt Your Name Email Address and Password hash was exposed in the breach. These are the only pieces of your personal data that was exposed. No other personal information was accessed. gt Although your password was stored as an irreversible hash in our database someone may still try to guess and match the hashed values to figure out your password. With high processing power of todays computers it is possible to try a large number of combinations in a short time. We strongly encourage you to change your password on any services where you might have used the same password as on Zomato. You can change your Zomato password here link valid for 7 days gt What are we doing about this gt We have since patched the vulnerability that led to this breach and have got the exposed data set delisted from public domain. As of now were actively working with cyber security experts to ensure all our systems are secure. Additionally we are undertaking following steps gt Were reaching out to all affected users like you to communicate the impact of the breach. gt As a precautionary measure to ensure extra security well be changing all authentication credentials in our system. This should not have any impact on you. Were changing our encryption algorithms to make it even more harder for someone to guess match passwords from the stored hash. Were adding safeguards to prevent any such incidents in the future. gt What can you do to improve your security online gt Make sure youre using a strong password that is unique to each service. In a lot of cases attackers would try the email password combination from leaked databases on other services. Using a password manager can help you use strong password and free you from having to remember the passwords. gt Services like LeakBase and HaveIBeenPawnd let you check if your data was involved in any security breaches. If you find your details on these services you should change your passwords immediately. gt While we apologize for the inconvenience we assure you that this incident has made our teams commitment to making Zomato a safer place for our users even stronger. We are constantly working to protect your information and privacy. gt If you have any questions or concerns around the incident please do reach out to us at supportzomato.com. gt Gunjan Patidar gt Chief Technology Officer gt Zomato.

Any girls/women here that would like an intro to computer science class: Hello there Im a 24F designer/engineer living in the US of A. Not long ago I used to live in India desperately seeking creative and tech work opportunities. I never really found any and eventually that led me to coming to USA for grad school. I graduated last year and now work as a designer in a software company. While I was in grad school I was introduced to the world of teaching which changed my live forever. There are tons of volunteering/teaching opportunities where I live but due to my visa situation I can only work one fulltime job and thus Im looking for new and creative ways to teach. A few years ago it would have made me really happy if someone on the internet offered to give me a oneonone lesson in computer science so here it is I specifically would like to reach out to women because I know what it feels like to be underrepresented it sucks.

The new material can absorb microwave radiation coming from enemy radars and thus prevent the radiation from getting reflected back to the detectors at the radar site. Radars work by emitting microwaves through a transmitter. The waves travel to the enemy aircrafts submarines and other targets and get reflected from their surface. Then a detector senses the reflected waves and identifies the targets. Radars are of five types L S C X and K depending upon the frequency of waves on which they operate. Modern warfare uses Xband radars as they employ high frequency microwaves that can detect aircrafts and submarines located thousands of miles away. To escape detection by radar warships are made using two types of materialscarbon fibers and ferrite composites. Both materials absorb microwaves. Compared to carbon fibers ferrite composites have several additional advantages. They are stable at high temperatures highly flexible strong and resistant to corrosion. Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur and Defense Laboratory Jodhpur have made a new ferrite composite. Named FMAR80 the new material is made by binding Nickel zinc ferrite powder in layers of a specialized rubber called NBR AcryloNitrile Butadiene Rubber. A simple and energyefficient chemical process is used to produce the material in less than 12 hours. FMAR80 can be used as a microwave absorber for strategic applications such as microwave stealth scientists have observed in their study published in journal Scientific Reports.

TIL about ECG Sudharshan whose contribution to quantum optics was looked over for Nobel Prize leading to protests from several other physicists.: Sudarshan began working on quantum optics at the University of Rochester in 1960. Two years later Glauber criticized the use of classical electromagnetic theory in explaining optical fields which surprised Sudarshan because he believed the theory provided accurate explanations. Sudarshan subsequently wrote a paper expressing his ideas and sent a preprint to Glauber. Glauber informed Sudarshan of similar results and asked to be acknowledged in the latters paper while criticizing Sudarshan in his own paper.[12] Glauber criticized Sudarshans representation but his own was unable to generate any of the typical quantum optics phenomena hence he introduces what he calls a Prepresentation which was Sudarshans representation by another name wrote a physicist. This representation which had at first been scorned by Glauber later becomes known as the SudarshanGlauber representation. Sudarshan has been passed over for the Physics Nobel Prize on more than one occasion leading to controversy in 2005 when several physicists wrote to the Swedish Academy protesting that Sudarshan should have been awarded a share of the Prize for the Sudarshan diagonal representation also known as SudarshanGlauber representation in quantum optics for which Roy J. Glauber won his share of the prize.[13] Sudarshan and others physicists sent a letter to the Nobel Committee claiming that the P representation had more contributions of Sudarshan than Glauber. The letter goes on to say that Glauber criticized Sudarshans theorybefore renaming it the P representation and incorporating it into his own work. In an unpublished letter to The New York Times Sudarshan calls the GlauberSudarshan representation a misnomer adding that literally all subsequent theoretic developments in the field of Quantum Optics make use of Sudarshans work essentially asserting that he had developed the breakthrough.[14] In 2007 Sudarshan told the Hindustan Times The 2005 Nobel prize for Physics was awarded for my work but I wasnt the one to get it. Each one of the discoveries that this Nobel was given for work based on my research.[15] Sudarshan also commented on not being selected for the 1979 Nobel Steven Weinberg Sheldon Glashow and Abdus Salam built on work I had done as a 26yearold student.

Think Hard Before Getting a Google Pixel in India: I dont get much free time to do this sort of thing but I am doing it anyway for others sake. Keeping it as short as possible. So I bought this phone on December 21 2016 from Flipkart the XL 32 gigs version. I was using it extremely happily for over a month until I noticed an issue. The phone has a touch screen problem. It could be hardware it could be software I dont know and at this point I dont care any more. I already mentioned about this problem in several places like Googles own community and on XDA itself you can find them with the following links https//forum.xdadevelopers.com/pixelxl/help/touchscreenissuespixelst3589758 https//productforums.google.com/forum/topic/phonebygoogle/uxoNCdIhMo0 Its already more than known that Google acknowledged the microphone issue due to some soldering problem and nonsense like that lens flare issue is known too along with bluetooth bug and random freezing and reboot problems but fortunately I didnt have any of those except the lens flare obviously which can be avoided if you know what you are doing. But so far there is no word from Google about the touch screen issue I mentioned. And I tired THREE Pixel XLs so far ALL OF THEM had the exact same problem so at this point I refuse to believe that there are Pixel phones which doesnt have the problem. Anyway for this problem alone I sold the phone after three months made a 23k loss irrelevant but still mentioning awful resale value anyway but within just two weeks I was DEARLY missing its beautiful camera so I bough another Pixel XL from a local store then price had come down by 5000 rupees by then LoL. And that phone is the reason I had to face nightmare for one week and basically creating this topic. You see that brand new phone phone came with a wall charger which wont charge the phone at all And then the vibration motor of the phone was dead ROFL. I used the phone like that for ten days just because I didnt have time to visit service centre. And the store I bought from clearly mentioned they cant give me a replacement phone and advised me to call Googles 24x7 customer care. So I called them and they asked me to submit the phone to TVS Electronics Ltd. in C.R. Avenue eMall Kolkata 72. So I went there and submitted the phone. I was more than certain that a phone which has a damaged vibration motor out of the box would be replaced with a brand new one. But no I was wrong. They said they would repair it only no way they can replace the phone. My phone was 14 days old when I submitted the phone if that matters in anything. Anyway so they took the phone and said they would call me when its done repairing it was a Saturday I remember. So I got a call on Monday I was told that phone was repaired so I wasted hours the service centre is almost 30 kms from my place and went to take my phone back only to find that ABSOLUTELY NOTHING was done and I mean NOTHING. I asked exactly why the heck did you guys call me They said sir to have the phone checked I am sure they have some psychological problems or something but whatever. Demanded I was not to be bothered unless something really has been done. So I got a call next day Tuesday problem was fixed again and this time it was real well somewhat. They changed the vibration motor and they provided me with a new AC wall adapter. Alls fine right NO In the process of removing the frontal panel of the phone to replace the vibration motor they scratched the front camera lens SEVERELY which I didnt notice in service centre anyway you cant check everything you know and the rear glass panel was also scratched pretty moderately And I am not even mentioning the opening marks around the bezel which could be noticed if you know what you are looking for. So on Wednesday I went there again to fix those problems and they took the phone again and they called me next day as usual Thursday that problems are fixed. But only front camera was cleaned now the camera wasnt as blurry like before but there is no way for me to tell whether it was as good as it came out of the box. And nothing was done to the rear glass panel it was just as scuffed. But as it was the fifth consecutive day I was visiting that same dumb sodding place there was no way for me to go back there again so I took the phone as it is and I sold the phone next day and this I made almost same amount of loss like my first one again irrelevant but mentioning all the same. Now again one week passed and I was missing that god damned camera again. So as they say third time is the charm and I thought I was one of them unlucky person to have two problematic units. So it was time for me to test a third Pixel phone and this time I wasnt ready to buy one LoL. So I found my client who was using an XL as well and I took his phone and checked for the same touch screen problem and bang it took less than 10 minutes to replicate the problem. I update to latest 7.1.2 of that time E labelled firmware if I remember right before checking and the problem was there in its fully glory. So its a 100 record amongst THREE PIXEL XLs. At this point I gave up. Now thing thing is the phone even with that problem is the smoothest android phone I have ever used it had incredible call quality and its almost known by now that the phone has the best possible camera on any mobile phone as of now. But that touch screen problem is unacceptable simple as that. Even if you are not a gamer you might notice the problem. Google Pixel keyboard tapping problem you will see them tappers who taps fast had mentioned inaccurate tapping I do believe that its the exact same thing here. Tapping on a on screen keyboard fast is exact same way of replicating the problem I had for games so yeah different apps but same end result phone missing a few touches. Now this reason alone is not why I am advising against getting the phone its Googles attitude towards their customer and this applies in India especially and HTCs awful after sales like mentioned above. After having that nightmarish experience I called Googles 24x7 support and explained my situation in details they said they are escalating the case but absolutely nothing was done and I never heard back from them. So my main concern here is how savagely Google is treating their Indian customers. Just visit and see how many people are having problems with HTC service centre in India https//productforums.google.com/forum/forum/phonebygoogle I hope with Pixel 2 the situation changes and all of us who have had this sort of awful experience with after sales service demands an arduous apology from Google at the very least. So if you are planning to get one go on but you were cautioned remember that. PS I am just adding the service centre job sheets in case there is one civilised person in Google come across this topic IMEI and serial blurred out on purpose obviously http//i.imgur.com/r5AgX6r.jpg http//i.imgur.com/bRt2SkN.jpg Thanks for reading and wasting your ten minutes Saurav.

India context on the malaria vaccine being piloted in Africa: TLDR Cases of malaria are increasing panic You might have seen [this news]http//www.bbc.com/news/health39666132 on the FP. Relevant excerpt below gt The pilot will involve more than 750000 children aged between five and 17 months. Around half will get the vaccine in order to compare the jabs realworld effectiveness. In this age group the four doses have been shown to prevent nearly four in ten cases of malaria. This is much lower than approved vaccines for other conditions. Malaria vaccine How good is good enough It also cuts the most severe cases by a third and reduces the number of children needing hospital treatment or blood transfusions. But the benefits fall off significantly without the crucial fourth dose. So thats a 40 reduction in incidence cant figure out the math for mortality I think its 33. First the good news on malaria. Even though malaria has been a part of India so long that even the vedas allegedly catch a mention of it inb4 kulcha warrior its just context we have been doing really well in reduction of cases. Cases in India have gone [down from 2 million per year to 881k in 2013]http//www.who.int/features/2015/indiaprogrammeendmalaria/en/ mostly through preventive measures like regular spraying and mosquito nets. Now the bad news The Indian government is actually cutting spending on malaria. This could be based on a naive reading of the drop in malarial incidence in 2013 budget for malaria was cut by 50 in 2013. This is leading to a loss of preventative coverage for a large chunk of the atrisk population 80 in 2014. Whats even more surprising is that there doesnt seem to be a [correlation between spending and incidence]http//www.indiaspend.com/coverstory/communicablediseasesrise32in5yearsspendingup781669. Whatever the reason malaria is coming back up with 1.2 million cases reported in 201516 as oppposed to only 881k in 2013 In an agrarian economy we need irrigation like we need air. And it seems that [being near irrigation infrastructure is a risk factor]https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15827275 that wont be going away any time soon. Results are still divided on whether malarial fever impairs cognitive development. Some say [no]https//malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s1293601509177 some say [maybe]https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK3738/. What is certain is that getting malaria sucks absolute ass. You cant work. And when the fever is on you can barely think. The estimated [lostlabor burden of malaria is 1.4 billion]http//www.searo.who.int/publications/journals/seajph/seajphv3n1p97.pdf. And what would any review of anything nowadays be without some concession for jumla/spin/posttruth. Indias malaria authorities claim that deaths due to malaria are consistently trending downwards. However there is a [infamous study]http//thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS01406736\10\608318.pdf out there which claims that Indias deaths from malaria are underreported and that the difference between the 217 deaths reported in 2015 and the real number of deaths due to malaria might be nearly 100x. In summary rolling out the vaccine effectively may save us 560 million dollars 1.4Bn40 and between 71 to 71000 lives per year. Rolling out the polio vaccine was [estimated to cost us]https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5094121/ 5.2 billion from 20132017 1.3 billion a year. Seems like a reasonable enough return for a good quality of life for hundreds of thousands of people. lteditgt Additional input from u/indianthrowawayn compels me to note that a 40 efficiency is fuckall compared to something like the polio or smallpox vaccines. The beeb has also covered [this very fair point]http//www.bbc.com/news/health33640616 in reasonable detail. A particularly nice quote from that article is gt in the cold light of day for most countries it comes down to a complex calculation based on the cost effectiveness lives saved illness avoided and the availability of other effective interventions. lt/editgt And for the compulsive depressives theres always some good news. The organism not bacteria can you believe it responsible for malaria has a [documented ability to develop strains with an immunity]https//www.cdc.gov/malaria/malariaworldwide/reduction/drugresistance.html to commonly used treatments like mefloquine halofantrine quinine and even the best and brightest tool in the feverdoctors toolkit [artemisinin]https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemisinin. So its possible we may never be rid of the fuckers even with this 40 percenter vaccines and prevention. But damned if we cant give it a shot. Obligatory disclaimer this is all random googling being put together as a reaction to the news and my own experience with malaria so its possible Im completely off base. Feel free to correct me with sources. Just thought it was cool that we now have a vaccine against a disease old enough to be described as prehistoric. Additional info [new story broke about artemisa annua]https//www.wpi.edu/news/patientsdrugresistantmalariacuredplanttherapydevelopedworcesterpolytechnicinstitute leaves causing a 100 recovery in severe malaria.

MTNL Is Still Injecting Ads This Time with a New Partner and Its a Privacy Nightmare: I am reposting this from https//broadbandforum.co/threads/137809/ MTNL is still injecting ads in users browsers and has a new partner Phozeca this time the information sent to this unknown third party is baffling and the way in which its sent is preposterous. I have been a MTNL customer for quite some time a rather long time I should say and all in all its a been a fairly good service but recently the tricks theyve been pulling up are changing my opinion. I remember seeing MTNL popups in the beginning of 2014 as was the case with many users which I would find much later I didnt think much of these then and dismissed them as a few annoying but sometimes even useful alerts from the company. These started getting frequent but not to the point that I would actually do something about them. Later in the year I saw popup ads appearing in the corners of websites it didnt even cross my mind that these ads were actually being served by MTNL I just thought these must be some new kind of ads on websites. This went on the popups and ads kept coming and I kept dismissing them. Until I ran into this thread by /u/Sushubh https//www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/408ceq/mtnlandbsnlbroadbandarebothinjectingadson/ Its now when I realized that the little ads in the corner werent displayed by the website but my own ISP to whom I was paying for internet services. I didnt mind the MTNL alerts but to think that I put up with its ads for two years... I went to https//broadbandforum.co/threads/78432/ back then and read up on the thread seeing the way they were injecting these ads and collecting user data was beyond what I imagined giving my data to a third party thats a no no as well. I decided to block these ads and alerts by blocking their server which was 203.94.248.40 didnt see the ads and alerts after that. This was until this past December when I noticed these again I simply blocked the domain that was serving these http//mtnl.phozeca.com I was intrigued to look into this new party serving me these ads but didnt. A few days ago someone on https//broadbandforum.co posted that MTNL has abandoned these ads so I went to look if this really was the case it wasnt but what I found was preposterous. I went to a http// page to check the claim made by the user in this case I went to http//indianexpress.com and looked at the network request and sure enough the ad network request by MTNL was blocked by the rule I had set earlier but what I had not seen at that time was the amount of data being sent. The simple ad request initiated by MTNL included so much data in just the URL I was flabbergasted it included my phone number my IP address my screen size etc. in just the http// header Network Request Paste2.org Viewing Paste WaH6YYmp this info could easily have been snooped up by anyone and who knows what info they might have already given to this ad partner. I decided to check who exactly were these guys who are getting my data. Turns out their company Phozeca Digital Services Pvt. Ltd http//www.phozeca.com was registered on 18 July 2014 the time when the MTNL ads initially started and guess where their office is according to their own website its in Gurgaon the same place where the first MTNL ad partner Adphonso was located makes you suspicious doesnt it. They also have a very familiar working model gtThe most efficient and reliable user engagement method of communicating directly with subscribers on any device in a nondisruptive and costeffective manner. The right messageright timeright subscriberright device approach has helped the internet users across the globe to meet their timecritical communication needs along with giving an additional revenue stream to the service providers through ad monetization of their networks. Hmmm... These very well could be the same guys but cant say for certain. On a side note the guy who runs this company previously ran a travel company https//www.tofler.in/basicsignatoryinfo/06859607 guess the travails of the travels didnt turn out too good for him. Haha... Well I am tired of running around and blocking these unsolicited ads and have finally sent a DND request to the GM of my region http//mtnldelhi.in/gmdgm.htm and hope this will stop. What makes me sad is the fact that most MTNL users dont even know these ads are served by their own ISP who they are paying to. This still should not be allowed and TRAI should take a stand on this I cant believe they havent till now.. 5 growing Jaipur startups turning the Pink City green: [deleted].

GST Is anyone here working in Infosys on the GSTN project or knows anyone who does: I am technology professional interested in learning more about the GSTN project and how the team at Infosys is solving it. Looks like it is this mammoth task that will be unprecedented in terms of the scale and complexity it will be operating at yet not much is being spoken or written about it. I am partly skeptical and partly curious about its fate. Are we ready and resilient enough to build this network Any attack inefficiency or just a bug in the system will potentially cause a tremendous damage to the economy and our reputation as a nation. I am calling out for folks here who may be related to this project or know someone who is.

Helpchat/Tapzo leaked user data. Lets have a real discussion about how AADHAAR works as developers: Here is a quick video tutorial on AADHAAR for developers https//www.youtube.com/watchvdLkRoPYMhIE So from what I understand businesses who want to use AADHAR for authentication should get some kind of a permit and are called AUAs or Authentication user agencies. The main structure is https//image.slidesharecdn.com/aadhaarinnovationideas150302223902conversiongate01/95/aadhaaridentityinnovationideas16638.jpgcb1425337281 You provide aadhaar number and another set of information to the API/service and it returns whether the data match. You can send basic data like name DOB address and request a match with AADHAAR number or you can have more sophisticated authentication system where you can send fingerprint or iris scan data and aadhaar number and ask the service to authenticate. The main issue I have is now if businesses start requesting your fingerprint for authentication what is stopping them from storing that data They could store my fingerprint scan and send it along with my aadhaar number for authentication whenever needed. Iphone has a strong feature in this case atleast they claim that the fingerprint data is stored locally in your iphone and is not accessible by any of the apps. The fingerprint sensor is off limits too for apps an app can request fingerprint authentication system from ios and IOS does the comparison with stored fingerprint data and authenticates for the third party app. I dont expect business vendors to be this careful with our fingerprint. It is only a matter of time before someone comes up with a way to store your fingerprint data locally and then it is a cluster fuck. Thoughts. Knowledge4ever Introduction.

The severe lack of skilled and experienced people in India who will do really difficult and sophisticated things: I recently reviewed/checked the tendering process at a government entity. I also audit the contractual payments management and stuffs at the said entity. Now this entity is involved in doing public work and does some pretty complex work. I was checking the civil tenders/contracts and almost all of the work was awarded to Indian contractors. LampT Pratibha HCC you name it. However as the work moved to electrical EampM procurement of machinery etc the number of Indian entities just thinned to the point when there were almost no Indian entity bidding. When I say Indian I mean a company based in India with majority holding by investors based in India and does not include Indian subsidiaries of foreign company. There were just no indigenous Indian company None. This was not the first time I was looking at contract agreements/tender documents but I had never thought much about it earlier. Dont get me wrong the civil work this government entity does is pretty sophisticated too and the Indian contractors do them well. But what I mean is that for things as basic as lifts/elevators it seems there are no good Indian contractors. Kone Johnson Schindler Hitachi Otis etc all are foreign companies who have Indian subsidiaries who carry out the work in India. Atmost it was awarded to an Indian contractor who was in a JV with a foreign company. I may be wrong and there may be good Indian lifts/elevator makers I do not know about. Also there were some machineries/equipment/parts or some works which can be manufactured/done by only a handful of foreign companies. In some case there was literally one foreign contractor who could do the work or supply the part. I then googled some of these companies. Most of them are like niche European or American companies. Companies whose history goes back 100150 years. Not even big some had just few thousand or something employees and revenues in millions but whose products no one can oneup. Companies who know their shit. Companies whose products probably define the cutting edge technology. Everything I wrote is probably common knowledge I guess. We import shit worth billions every year. It kind of baffles me. Heh.

[Rant] Education in India is toptier shit.: Before you read the whole thing I should warn you theres nothing here you probably dont know. Just a bunch of anecdotes and me expressing my frustration. My younger cousin got into a private engineering college last year and took up Computer Science. Its one of those famous but shitty North Indian colleges like LPU. I myself am a recent CS grad from a fairly reputed Indian engineering college so I was in a fantasy that Id assist my cousin with her education remotely since I have a job and all keep her on the right track and maybe shed do better than HCL/Wipro/Infosys type of jobs they usually get into. I find that impossible now. Their education and approach to CS is a total mess One time she pings me they need to make some project related to Computer Science and she needs some ideas. This was in their first semester. I asked her if there are any requirements laid down by the teachers. She said it just has to be a CS project. I asked her what kind of projects people usually make. She says last year a bunch of guys made a cellphone jammer. I asked her if they had done any programming yet. I knew they hadnt but I just did. She said no. I was like how the fuck does a first year student who hasnt done any programming program a microcontroller to get it to work like a cellphone jammer. In my first semester we were doing relatively stupid shit like getting our heads around C pointers and trying to figure out how to do binary tree traversal. She then suggested how about we make a fire alarm. She had previously asked me to help with a science project for her school I found out some circuit diagram online bought a bunch of parts assembled her and gave it to her. She then decided that the fire alarm thing would be too meh. This is a first year student who probably doesnt even know what a byte is let alone assembling a circuit on a breadboard. Long story short one of her teammates somehow arranged for a project and they survived somehow. A few months later I suppose at the beginning of her second semester she asks me what exactly is a car guard sensor using infrared sensor. She said she searched for it on youtube and didnt find anything. I told her that it could a hundred different things and that she should ask her professors exactly what theyre supposed to make. She told me that college was off that day and they received the name of the project on a whatsapp group and that was it. I asked her if she had any TAs and all she could get details from and she was like uhh okay. I told her if she wanted to build all these things its important that she learn programming first. She told me oh yeah I tried to search on youtube but couldnt find anything. This is the internet were talking about and a 18 year old CS student is claiming she couldnt find any basic programming resources Apparently her college puts in no efforts to impart skills theyd need for such projects and has no support structure for the student to contact professors or TAs after class. They get diktats to arrange for random projects now and then which have no correlation with their abilities or what theyve learned so far. They arrange for these projects from some senior or from some shop and get their grades. In my first year we were doing such relatively trivial stuff like learning linear algebra data structures C programming learning how linux works how to prepare documents using Latex and so on. She probably thinks Im a dick for not helping her figure out what car guard sensor using infrared sensor is but to be honest Im completely out of my depth here. I could probably buy an arduino set it up with the sensors anda ll and courier it to her but whats the point of all this Shell get grades but it will never result in any learning nor will those grades be respected anywhere in the job market. Its probably not that shes mediocre but surrounded by mediocrity that never inspires her to find something worth doing. I was excited when she took up CS thinking Ill be able to guide her into a real job with real skills but I cant find any way to start. Shell be lucky to get a job at infosys with those skills and keep thinking of me as a dick cousin who refused to help her with studies. EDIT Thanks for the attention and support guys. I realize that any discussion here is probably not going to have any direct impact on hers or her batchmates education but it feels good that this community allows people the space to vent out..

Follow up post.: Hi r/india. You may remember my post from some time ago sharing the fact that Airtel screwed me over by giving me a VFiber connection in Chennai but limited download speeds to 16Mbps 18Mbps on a good day and upload speeds to 0.5 Mbps. Original post here https//www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5kocuf/ifyoureconsideringupgradingtoairtelsnew/ Im sorry to say that the situation hasnt changed and Airtel is still screwing me and probably a lot of other people over. I went ahead and used a different mobile number to register for a new VFiber connection. I then started getting a bunch of calls from Airtel Sales people. I just used a different name and the same address where I have the existing line installed. Heres a summary of the conversations 1. I have a recorded conversation with a sales person promising me 40 Mbps download and 20 Mbps upload speeds. 2. I have a recorded conversation with another sales person promising me download speeds of 40100 Mbps and upload speeds of 12 Mbps. Apparently I was within 1000m of a certain landmark so I can expect these awesome speeds no doubt in her mind. 3. Another recorded conversation where the sales person said the maximum speed I can get is 2Mbps download wtf 4. A conversation with the technical person at the street level who says that at best I can get only 16 Mbps download and 5 Mbps upload. Theres no way I can get more due to my distance from whatever junction box they use. One of these jokers also gave me a toll free number to call to upgrade my VFiber connection to the actual speed this number is out of service. I sent The Appellate office the recording and they basically said that their sales team made an error and theyll make sure it wont happen again. They also said they will fix the false advertising on their website. Still hasnt been fixed apparently you can upload and download files in a jiffy. I asked for a refund apparently theyll look into it. Yeah right. I also complained on the Government public grievance portal and the appellate office responded and the response is attached to this post. I also complained to the Advertising Council of India they seem surprisingly interested in taking up the case and they have all the recordings and I will post back if I hear from them. In short record your conversations with Airtel Androids ACR app is great because they most likely will try to screw you over. Even if you do have recorded conversations they will still screw you over. Im so happy that my ACT connection is back so I can dump this garbage.

[TECH] Are Mumbais local ISPs breaking Net Neutrality with their absurd YouTube speeds: I recently shifted my residence in Mumbai and I got a new connection from some local ISP called Airnet Networks. I sort of overcompensated and got a 4mbps connection to share with my roomate for 1200pm. My old connection was by FiveNet 5mbps for 1600 pm shared with three people. FiveNet used to give me an IP transit speed of 23mpbs but Youtube/Amazon AWS services at 20mbps. Torrent caching would work at 810mbps. The point being these speeds were far above the advertised speeds. My new connection gives me an absurd IP transit speed of 4mbps as advertised on paper Youtube at 2530 mbps torrent caching at a mind blowing 64mbps and Amazon AWS at 1015 mbps. These local ISPs are clearly optimizing their networks to reduce IP transit usage and their advertised speeds are only to that extent. Many commonly used services such as Youtube Netflix Hotstar and torrents run at MUCH higher speeds. Simply because their infrastructure costs are sunk and they dont pay variable costs for this Would this kind of positive discrimination giving faster lanes to others as compared to negative discrimination throttling some traffic be a violation of net neutrality Considering that I am getting some awesome service right now. I would like to disagree..But what does randia think Network optimization also helps bring down bandwidth costs for ISPs and helps them offer these absurd plans at low rates. .

Flipkart is utilizing PhonePe and UPI in an amazing way: I just bought some stuff from Flipkart. I saw there was a new payment method PhonePe. Most of us here know what PhonePe is. For those who dont [please read this]https//www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5g3dul/hereisalistofalltheupiappscurrently/refsearchposts. So I chose PhonePe to try it out. The payment procedure was smooth as fuck. I chose PhonePe as payment method Got a notification on phone that Flipkart has requested a payment I go to Pending Transactions in PhonePe I see a transaction by Flipkart I tap the Pay button. I verify the amount I am paying. I enter my MPIN. Amount is deducted and the Flipkart web portal detects that I have paid. Order is confirmed. I usually dont have good things to say about Flipkart but theyre doing some great stuff here with PhonePe. I hope other portals also accept PhonePe so that we have some more simplicity when it comes to online payments..
